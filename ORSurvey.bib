abstract = {The operating room is a major cost and revenue center for most hospitals. Thus, more effective operating room management and scheduling can provide significant benefits. In many hospitals, the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), where patients recover after their surgical procedures, is a bottleneck. If the PACU reaches capacity, patients must wait in the operating room until the PACU has available space, leading to delays and possible cancellations for subsequent operating room procedures. We develop a generalizable optimization and machine learning approach to sequence operating room procedures to minimize delays caused by PACU unavailability. Specifically, we use machine learning to estimate the required PACU time for each type of surgical procedure, we develop and solve two integer programming models to schedule procedures in the operating rooms to minimize maximum PACU occupancy, and we use discrete event simulation to compare our optimized schedule to the existing schedule. Using data from Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford, we show that the scheduling system can significantly reduce operating room delays caused by PACU congestion while still keeping operating room utilization high: simulation of the second half of 2016 shows that our model could have reduced total PACU holds by 76% without decreasing operating room utilization. We are currently working on implementing the scheduling system at the hospital.},

abstract = {In a master surgery scheduling (MSS) problem, a hospital's operating room (OR) capacity is assigned to different medical specialties. This task is critical since the risk of assigning too much or too little OR time to a specialty is associated with overtime or deficit hours of the staff, deferral or delay of surgeries, and unsatisfied—or even endangered—patients. Most MSS approaches in the literature focus only on the OR while neglecting the impact on downstream units or reflect a simplified version of the real-world situation. We present the first prediction model for the integrated OR scheduling problem based on machine learning. Our three-step approach focuses on the intensive care unit (ICU) and reflects elective and urgent patients, inpatients and outpatients, and all possible paths through the hospital. We provide an empirical evaluation of our method with surgery data for Universit{\"{a}}tsklinikum Augsburg, a German tertiary care hospital with 1700 beds. We show that our model outperforms a state-of-the-art model by 43% in number of predicted beds. Our model can be used as supporting tool for hospital managers or incorporated in an optimization model. Eventually, we provide guidance to support hospital managers in scheduling surgeries more efficiently.},

abstract = {Operating rooms (ORs) play a substantial role in hospital profitability, and their optimal utilization is conducive to containing the cost of surgical service delivery, shortening surgical patient wait times, and increasing patient admissions. We extend the OR planning and scheduling problem from a single independent hospital to a coalition of multiple hospitals in a strategic network, where a pool of patients, surgeons, and ORs are collaboratively planned. To solve the resulting mixed-integer dual resource constrained model, we develop a novel logic-based Benders' decomposition approach that employs an allocation master problem, sequencing sub-problems for each hospital-day, and novel multistrategy Benders' feasibility and optimality cuts. We investigate various patient-tosurgeon allocation flexibilities, as well as the impact of surgeon schedule tightness. Using real data obtained from the General Surgery Departments of the University Health Network (UHN) hospitals, consisting of Toronto General Hospital, Toronto Western Hospital, and Princess Margret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (who already engage in some collaborative resource sharing),we find that on average, collaborative OR scheduling with traditional patient-to-surgeon allocation flexibility results in 6% cost-savings, while flexible patient-to-surgeon allocation flexibility increases cost-savings to 40%, and surgeon schedule tightness can impact costs by 15%. The collective impact of our collaboration and patient flexibility results in between 45% and 63% savings per surgery. We also use a game theoretic approach to fairly redistribute the payoff acquired from a coalition of hospitals and to empirically show coalitional stability among hospitals.},

Operative duration is an important factor that guides research on surgery scheduling. Clinical effects, for example, surgery type, rationally influences operative duration. In this study, we also investigate whether the planning and scheduling decisions in ORs influence the operative duration. Methods. For our study, we collected and reviewed data on 2,451 thoracic operations from a large hospital in China. The study was conducted over a period of 34 months. Linear and nonlinear regression models were used to detect the effects on the duration of the operations. We have also examined interactions between the factors. Results. Operative duration decreased with the number of operations a surgeon performed in a day (P<0.001). It was also found that operative duration decreased with the number of operations allocated to an OR, as long as there were not more than four surgeries per day (P<0.001). However, they increased with the number of operations if it was more than four (P<0.01). The duration of surgery was affected by its position in the sequencing of surgeries performed by a surgeon. In addition, the effects of surgeons depend on the surgery type as well as the position in the sequencing order. Conclusions. Operative duration was affected not only due to clinical effects but also some nonclinical effects. Scheduling decisions significantly influenced operative duration.},

The lack of scheduling of the operating rooms is often the cause of sudden displacements. A consequence is the conflict between patients and caregivers. Other causes of the increase of waiting times are the presence in the ward of a single trolley for medications and the presence of a single room for admission and preadmission of patients.

Using queuing and simulation methodology, this study attempted to add a volume guideline. Data from 72 previously verified trauma centers identified multiple demographic factors, including specific information about the first trauma-related operation that was done between 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM each month for 12 consecutive months. The annual admissions averaged 1,477 for 37 Level I trauma centers, 802 for 28 Level II trauma centers, 481 for 4 Level III trauma centers, and 731 for 3 pediatric trauma centers. The annual admissions correlated with the number of operations done between 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM (p < 0.001). These 946 operations were performed by general surgery (39%), neurosurgery (8%), orthopaedic surgery (33%), another specialty (9%), or multiple services (10%). Admission to operation time was within 30 minutes for 12.1% of patients (2.6% for blunt and 24.1% for penetrating injuries). The probability of operation within 30 minutes of arrival varied with the number of admissions and with the percentage of penetrating versus blunt injuries. The likely number of operations from 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM would be 19 for 500 annual admissions, 26 for 750 annual admissions, and 34 for 1,000 annual admissions, with 5.83, 7.98, and 10.13 patients, respectively, going to operation within 30 min. The probability that two rooms would be occupied simultaneously was 0.14 and 0.24 for centers admitting 500 and 1,000 patients, respectively. Trauma centers performing fewer than six operations between 11:00 PM and 7:00 AM per year could conserve resources by using an immediately available on-call team, with responses monitored by the performance-improvement program.},

abstract = {For effective operating room (OR) planning, surgery duration estimation is critical. Overestimation leads to underutilization of expensive hospital resources (e.g., OR time) whereas underestimation leads to overtime and high waiting times for the patients. In this paper, we consider a particular estimation method currently in use and using additional temporal, operational, and staff-related factors provide a statistical model to adjust these estimates for higher accuracy. The results show that our method increases the accuracy of the estimates, in particular by reducing large errors. For the 8093 cases we have in our data, our model decreases the mean absolute deviation of the currently used scheduled duration (42.65 ± 0.59 minutes) by 1.98 ± 0.28 minutes. For the cases with large negative errors, however, the decrease in the mean absolute deviation is 20.35 ± 0.74 minutes (with a respective increase of 0.89 ± 0.66 minutes in large positive errors). We find that not only operational and temporal factors, but also medical staff and team experience related factors (such as number of nurses and the frequency of the medical team working together) could be used to improve the currently used estimates. Finally, we conclude that one could further improve these predictions by combining our model with other good prediction models proposed in the literature. Specifically, one could decrease the mean absolute deviation of 39.98 ± 0.58 minutes obtained via the method ofDexter et al (Anesth Analg 117(1):204–209, 2013) by 1.02 ± 0.21 minutes by combining our method with theirs.},

Semi-urgent surgeries, to be performed soon but not necessarily today, pose an uncertain demand on available hospital resources, and interfere with the planning of elective patients. For a highly utilized OR, reservation of OR time for semi-urgent surgeries avoids excessive cancellations of elective surgeries, but may also result in unused OR time, since arrivals of semi-urgent patients are unpredictable. First, using a queuing theory framework, we evaluate the OR capacity needed to accommodate every incoming semi-urgent surgery. Second, we introduce another queuing model that enables a trade-off between the cancelation rate of elective surgeries and unused OR time. Third, based on Markov decision theory, we develop a decision support tool that assists the scheduling process of elective and semi-urgent surgeries. We demonstrate our results with actual data obtained from a department of neurosurgery. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

@article{Zhou1999,
abstract = {Study Objective: To determine whether using only previous cases' surgical times for predicting accurately surgical times of future cases is likely to reduce the average length of time cases finish late (after their scheduled finish times).Design: Computer simulation.Measurements and Main Results: Data from an operating room (OR) information system for two surgical suites were analyzed. For each case performed in fiscal year 1996, we searched backward for 1 year and counted the number of previous cases that were the same type of procedure performed by the same surgeon. Then, for each suite, surgical times were fitted to a statistical model estimating the effect of the type of procedure and who the surgeon was on surgical time. The estimated 'variance components' were used in Monte-Carlo computer simulations to evaluate whether a hypothetical increase in the number of previous cases available to estimate the next case's surgical time would improve scheduling accuracy. Predictions of how long newly scheduled cases should take were impaired because 36.5% ± 0.4% (mean ± SE) of cases at a tertiary surgical suite and 28.6% ± 0.7% of cases at an ambulatory surgery center did not have any cases in the previous year with the same procedure type and surgeon. Computer simulation was used to generate additional hypothetical cases. Using this data, even having many previous cases on which to base predictions of future surgical times would only decrease the average length of time that cases finish late by a few minutes.Conclusion: An OR manager considering using only historical surgical times to estimate future surgical times should first investigate, using data from their own surgical suite, what percentage of cases do not have historical data. Even if there are sufficient historical data to estimate future surgical times accurately, relying solely on historical times is probably an ineffective strategy to have future cases finish on time.

abstract = {Objectives: Operating room (OR) surgery scheduling determines the individual surgery's operation start time and assigns the required resources to each surgery over a schedule period, considering several constraints related to a complete surgery flow and the multiple resources involved. This task plays a decisive role in providing timely treatments for the patients while balancing hospital resource utilization. The originality of the present study is to integrate the surgery scheduling problem with real-life nurse roster constraints such as their role, specialty, qualification and availability. This article proposes a mathematical model and an ant colony optimization (ACO) approach to efficiently solve such surgery scheduling problems. Method: A modified ACO algorithm with a two-level ant graph model is developed to solve such combinatorial optimization problems because of its computational complexity. The outer ant graph represents surgeries, while the inner graph is a dynamic resource graph. Three types of pheromones, i.e. sequence-related, surgery-related, and resource-related pheromone, fitting for a two-level model are defined. The iteration-best and feasible update strategy and local pheromone update rules are adopted to emphasize the information related to the good solution in makespan, and the balanced utilization of resources as well. The performance of the proposed ACO algorithm is then evaluated using the test cases from (1) the published literature data with complete nurse roster constraints, and 2) the real data collected from a hospital in China. Results: The scheduling results using the proposed ACO approach are compared with the test case from both the literature and the real life hospital scheduling. Comparison results with the literature shows that the proposed ACO approach has (1) an 1.5-h reduction in end time; (2) a reduction in variation of resources' working time, i.e. 25% for ORs, 50% for nurses in shift 1 and 86% for nurses in shift 2; (3) an 0.25. h reduction in individual maximum overtime (OT); and (4) an 42% reduction in the total OT of nurses. Comparison results with the real 10-workday hospital scheduling further show the advantage of the ACO in several measurements. Instead of assigning all surgeries by a surgeon to only one OR and the same nurses by traditional manual approach in hospital, ACO realizes a more balanced surgery arrangement by assigning the surgeries to different ORs and nurses. It eventually leads to shortening the end time within the confidential interval of [7.4%, 24.6%] with 95% confidence level. Conclusion: The ACO approach proposed in this paper efficiently solves the surgery scheduling problem with daily nurse roster while providing a shortened end time and relatively balanced resource allocations. It also supports the advantage of integrating the surgery scheduling with the nurse scheduling and the efficiency of systematic optimization considering a complete three-stage surgery flow and resources involved.},

Source of uncertainties may come from the patient or the surgery itself, where several cases require immediate changes in data, such as when surgery delays or cancellation occurs on the same day. The study aimed to model the uncertainties for managing identified uncertainties during the continuous scheduling, framed by resilience concept to cope with the system fragility. In order to be able to control and adjust any changes which may affect the surgery schedule of the day, we provide alternatives of solution rather than strictly decide the best valued options. We identified dimensions of uncertainties and categorized them based on the resilience concept, computed the impact value of potentially conflicted resources as a result of schedule change. With the model applied, we would provide a list of most acceptable and less vulnerable alternatives for anesthesiologist as a scheduler to build resilience in the surgical scheduling.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: As the demand for health care services increases, the need to improve patient flow between departments has likewise increased. Understanding how the master surgical schedule (MSS) affects the inpatient wards and exploiting this relationship can lead to a decrease in surgery cancellations, a more balanced workload, and an improvement in resource utilization. We modeled this relationship and used the model to evaluate and select a new MSS for a hospital. METHODS: An operational research model was used in combination with staff input to develop a new MSS. A series of MSSs were proposed by staff, evaluated by the model, and then scrutinized by staff. Through iterative modifications of the MSS proposals (i.e., the assigned operating time of specialties), insight is obtained into the number, type, and timing of ward admissions, and how these affect ward occupancy. RESULTS: After evaluating and discussing a number of proposals, a new MSS was chosen that was acceptable to operating room staff and that balanced the ward occupancy. After implementing the new MSS, a review of the bed-use statistics showed it was achieving a balanced ward occupancy. The model described in this article gave the hospital the ability to quantify the concerns of multiple departments, thereby providing a platform from which a new MSS could be negotiated. CONCLUSION: The model, used in combination with staff input, supported an otherwise subjective discussion with quantitative analysis. The work in this article, and in particular the model, is readily repeatable in other hospitals and relies only on readily available data.

abstract = {Delayed starts of operation room (OR) processes in the morning lead to suboptimal use of expensive OR personnel and resources. Therefore, the anaesthesiologist has to take care that anaesthesia preparation and induction are finished in time and the patients are ready for the surgical intervention according to the OR time schedule. However, if the anaesthesiologist starts too early, preincision waiting periods occur. The literature provides little data regarding the complex interaction of anaesthesia process times and delayed operation starts in the morning. In this prospective study 710 first operation positions in the morning were analyzed with respect to the incidence of and reasons for delayed finishing of anaesthesia induction and investigated the interaction of early and late finishing of anaesthesia induction. In 27.5% of anaesthesia inductions the preset time schedule was not reached and the average delay was 19.3±17.2 min. The main anaesthesia-dependent reasons for delays were complex anaesthesia inductions with difficult line placement. Also organizational difficulties such as changes in the OR case schedule and delayed patient transport were of major importance. The results of a simulation model showed that in 100% of the cases finishing anaesthesia induction in time would only be feasible if anaesthesia processes started much earlier. However, this would lead to a sharp increase in preincision waiting time with the patient being under anaesthesia but surgeons not ready to start, therefore having only a minor effect on surgical waiting time. Subsequently, on-time anaesthesia induction in all cases is not a reasonable target in OR management. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Medizin Verlag.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gains in operating room (OR) scheduling may be obtained by using accurate statistical models to predict surgical and procedure times. The 3 main contributions of this article are the following: (i) the validation of Strum's results on the statistical distribution of case durations, including surgeon effects, using OR databases of 2 European hospitals, (ii) the use of expert prior expectations to predict durations of rarely observed cases, and (iii) the application of the proposed methods to predict case durations, with an analysis of the resulting increase in OR efficiency. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all recorded surgical cases of 2 large European teaching hospitals from 2005 to 2008, involving 85,312 cases and 92,099 h in total. Surgical times tended to be skewed and bounded by some minimally required time. We compared the fit of the normal distribution with that of 2- and 3-parameter lognormal distributions for case durations of a range of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)-anesthesia combinations, including possible surgeon effects. For cases with very few observations, we investigated whether supplementing the data information with surgeons' prior guesses helps to obtain better duration estimates. Finally, we used best fitting duration distributions to simulate the potential efficiency gains in OR scheduling. RESULTS: The 3-parameter lognormal distribution provides the best results for the case durations of CPT-anesthesia (surgeon) combinations, with an acceptable fit for almost 90% of the CPTs when segmented by the factor surgeon. The fit is best for surgical times and somewhat less for total procedure times. Surgeons' prior guesses are helpful for OR management to improve duration estimates of CPTs with very few (<10) observations. Compared with the standard way of case scheduling using the mean of the 3-parameter lognormal distribution for case scheduling reduces the mean overreserved OR time per case up to 11.9 (11.8-12.0) min (55.6%) and the mean underreserved OR time per case up to 16.7 (16.5-16.8) min (53.1%). When scheduling cases using the 4-parameter lognormal model the mean overutilized OR time is up to 20.0 (19.7-20.3) min per OR per day lower than for the standard method and 11.6 (11.3-12.0) min per OR per day lower as compared with the biased corrected mean. CONCLUSIONS: OR case scheduling can be improved by using the 3-parameter lognormal model with surgeon effects and by using surgeons' prior guesses for rarely observed CPTs. Using the 3-parameter lognormal model for case-duration prediction and scheduling significantly reduces both the prediction error and OR inefficiency. {\textcopyright} 2009 by International Anesthesia Research Society.},

abstract = {Background: Since operating rooms are a major bottleneck resource and an important revenue driver in hospitals, it is important to use these resources efficiently. Studies estimate that between 60 and 70% of hospital admissions are due to surgeries. Furthermore, staffing cannot be changed daily to respond to changing demands. The resulting high complexity in operating room management necessitates perpetual process evaluation and the use of decision support tools. In this study, we evaluate several management policies and their consequences for the operating theater of the University Hospital Augsburg. Methods: Based on a data set with 12,946 surgeries, we evaluate management policies such as parallel induction of anesthesia with varying levels of staff support, the use of a dedicated emergency room, extending operating room hours reserved as buffer capacity, and different elective patient sequencing policies. We develop a detailed simulation model that serves to capture the process flow in the entire operating theater: scheduling surgeries from a dynamically managed waiting list, handling various types of schedule disruptions, rescheduling and prioritizing postponed and deferred surgeries, and reallocating operating room capacity. The system performance is measured by indicators such as patient waiting time, idle time, staff overtime, and the number of deferred surgeries. Results: We identify significant trade-offs between expected waiting times for different patient urgency categories when operating rooms are opened longer to serve as end-of-day buffers. The introduction of parallel induction of anesthesia allows for additional patients to be scheduled and operated on during regular hours. However, this comes with a higher number of expected deferrals, which can be partially mitigated by employing additional anesthesia teams. Changes to the sequencing of elective patients according to their expected surgery duration cause expectable outcomes for a multitude of performance indicators. Conclusions: Our simulation-based approach allows operating theater managers to test a multitude of potential changes in operating room management without disrupting the ongoing workflow. The close collaboration between management and researchers in the design of the simulation framework and the data analysis has yielded immediate benefits for the scheduling policies and data collection efforts at our practice partner.},

abstract = {Because operating room (OR) management decisions with optimal choices are made with ubiquitous biases, decisions are improved with decision-support systems. We reviewed experimental social-psychology studies to explore what an OR leader can do when working with stakeholders lacking interest in learning the OR management science but expressing opinions about decisions, nonetheless. We considered shared information to include the rules-of-thumb (heuristics) that make intuitive sense and often seem "close enough" (e.g., staffing is planned based on the average workload). We considered unshared information to include the relevant mathematics (e.g., staffing calculations). Multiple studies have shown that group discussions focus more on shared than unshared information. Quality decisions are more likely when all group participants share knowledge (e.g., have taken a course in OR management science). Several biases in OR management are caused by humans' limited abilities to estimate tails of probability distributions in their heads. Groups are more susceptible to analogous biases than are educated individuals. Since optimal solutions are not demonstrable without groups sharing common language, only with education of most group members can a knowledgeable individual influence the group. The appropriate model of decision-making is autocratic, with information obtained from stakeholders. Although such decisions are good quality, the leaders often are disliked and the decisions considered unjust. In conclusion, leaders will find the most success if they do not bring OR management operational decisions to groups, but instead act autocratically while obtaining necessary information in 1:1 conversations. The only known route for the leader making such decisions to be considered likable and for the decisions to be considered fair is through colleagues and subordinates learning the management science.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To identify preoperative clinical characteristics affecting cataract surgery operative time. SETTING: Academic center. DESIGN: Large-scale retrospective cohort study. METHODS: All cases of cataract extraction by phacoemulsification and intraocular lens insertion performed by Comprehensive Ophthalmology at Massachusetts Eye and Ear between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2014, were reviewed. Clinically relevant predictors of operative time were identified a priori, and a multivariate analysis was used to identify which predictors were associated with operative time. To quantify the surgeon effect, 2 regression models were built, one inclusive of surgeon identity and the other with years of experience and the training level of the supervised resident instead of identity. RESULTS: Overall, 1349 cataract surgeries in 1072 patients were included. The mean operative time was 22.1 ± 7.8 minutes. Multiple clinical factors were significantly associated with operative time, with attending surgeon identity being the most important. In the multivariate model with surgeon identity, longer operative time was associated with male sex, increased body mass index, first-eye surgery, left operative eye, advanced cataract, use of iris hooks, use of Malyugin ring, use of trypan blue, history of diabetic retinopathy, short axial length, and shallow anterior chamber depth. The R value for the model inclusive of attending identity was 0.42, significantly higher than the R value of 0.23 for the model exclusive of identity. CONCLUSION: Preoperative clinical characteristics, such as patient demographics, biometry data, and cataract severity, significantly correlate with operative time. Surgeon identity is highly correlated with operative time. Incorporating these results into predictive algorithms may allow for more predictable surgical scheduling and more efficient use of operative resources.},

The organ procurement center (OPC) model may be one way to mitigate these issues. Liver transplants from 2009 to 2016 were reviewed. There were 755 liver transplants performed with 525 OPC and 230 in-hospital procurements. The majority of transplants (87.4%) were started during daytime hours (5 am-7 pm). Transplants with any portion occurring after-hours were more likely to have procurements in-hospital (P <.001). Daytime cases (n = 400) had more OPC procured livers and hepatitis C recipients and were less likely to have a donation after circulatory death donor (all P <.05). In adjusted analyses, daytime cases were independently associated with extubation in the operating room and less postoperative transfusion. There were no significant differences in short- or long-term postoperative outcomes. For exported livers, 54.3% were procured by a local team, saving 137 flights (151 559 miles). The OPC resulted in optimally timed liver transplants and decreased resource utilization with no negative impact on patient outcomes. It allows for ease in exporting organs procured by local surgeons, and potentially addresses provider burnout, the transplant surgery pipeline, and surgeon travel.},

Then, we proposed four easy-to-implement heuristics that can guarantee to find feasible solutions for the studied problem efficiently. Furthermore, we presented four local search procedures that can improve a given solution significantly. Finally, a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) that incorporated with initial solutions, local search procedures and elite search procedure is applied to the studied problem. Computational results show that for small problem instances, the HGA can find near optimal solutions efficiently while for large problem instances, the HGA performs significantly better than the four proposed heuristics. We concluded that surgery schedules obtained by using HGA has less wasting cost for the unused time, much higher utilization of operating rooms, and produce less overtime-operating cost.},

A well-designed schedule should be concerned with the welfare of the entire system by allocating the available resources in an efficient and effective manner. In this paper, we develop an integer linear programming model in a manner useful for multiple goals for optimally scheduling elective surgeries based on the availability of surgeons and operating rooms over a time horizon. In particular, the model is concerned with the minimization of the following important goals: (1) the anticipated number of patients waiting for service; (2) the underutilization of operating room time; (3) the maximum expected number of patients in the recovery unit; and (4) the expected range (the difference between maximum and minimum expected number) of patients in the recovery unit. We develop two goal programming (GP) models: lexicographic GP model and weighted GP model. The lexicographic GP model schedules operating rooms when various preemptive priority levels are given to these four goals. A numerical study is conducted to illustrate the optimal master-surgery schedule obtained from the models. The numerical results demonstrate that when the available number of surgeons and operating rooms is known without error over the planning horizon, the proposed models can produce good schedules and priority levels and preference weights of four goals affect the resulting schedules. The results quantify the tradeoffs that must take place as the preemptive-weights of the four goals are changed.},

abstract = {Purpose – Previous studies approach surgery scheduling mainly from the mathematical modeling perspective which is often hard to apply in a practical environment. The aim of this study is to develop a practical scheduling system that considers the advantages of both surgery categorization and newsvendor model to surgery scheduling. Design/methodology/approach – The research was carried out in a Finnish orthopaedic specialist centre that performs only joint replacement surgery. Four surgery categorization scenarios were defined and their productivity analyzed by simulation and newsvendor model. Findings – Detailed analyses of surgery durations and the use of more accurate case categories and their combinations in scheduling improved OR productivity 11.3 percent when compared to the base case. Planning to have one OR team to work longer led to remarkable decrease in scheduling inefficiency. Practical implications – In surgical services, productivity and cost-efficiency can be improved by utilizing historical data in case scheduling and by increasing flexibility in personnel management. Originality/value – The study increases the understanding of practical scheduling methods used to improve efficiency in surgical services. {\textcopyright} 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

The first step uses an original integer programming model to address the tactical planning problem of assigning provider duties to defined shifts while incorporating a number of constraints. Given provider scheduling preferences and availability, a monthly schedule is determined to satisfy the expected demand. The second step consists of quantifying capacity increases that result from adjustments to operating hours, physician availability, and examination room availability. A discrete-event simulation model is used to assess the impact of various proposed operating configurations on patient throughput.},

abstract = {Self-directed learning is associated with knowledge and performance improvements, increased identification and amelioration of knowledge gaps, and heightened critical appraisal of available evidence. We developed and implemented a decision support system that could support self-directed learning for anesthesia residents by soliciting resident input in case selection. We hypothesized that residents would utilize this system to request complex cases, and that more advanced residents would request more complex cases. Prospective, observational study involving 101 anesthesiology residents. We used a web-based interface, RHINOS [Residents Helping in Navigating Operating Room (OR) Scheduling], which allowed residents to share their rank-ordered preferences for OR assignment. Number of cases per OR, anesthesia base units, time units, and proportion of inpatient cases were used as proxies for case complexity. Data were analyzed using a mixed linear model. Residents requested rooms with fewer cases [F(3,22,350) = 194.0; p < 0.001], more base units [F(3,19,158) = 291.4; p < 0.001], more time units [F(3,19,744) = 186.4; p < 0.001], and a greater proportion of cases requiring inpatient preoperative evaluation [F(3,51,929) = 11.3; p < 0.001]. In most cases, these differences were greater for more advanced residents. As hypothesized, residents requested ORs with higher case complexity, and these cases more often required inpatient preoperative evaluation. More advanced residents exhibited a stronger preference for more educational cases than junior residents.},

abstract = {Under the constraints of limited medical resources and severe competition among hospitals, administrators have begun to pay attention to the opportunities of cost reduction and quality improvement in hospital management, in order to find methods to increase hospital revenue and improve service quality. The operating room should be one of the most important sources of hospital income, yet it is both costly to run and constrictive to inpatient flow. Successful hospital management necessitates the construction of cost-effective and quality operating room scheduling. This paper attempts to model the scheduling problem in the form of mathematical programming with the objective being to minimize the deviation between the total operation time and the total available time in operating rooms. Urgent revisions to the model in consideration of such factors as doctor's availability, outpatient consulting hours and unfavorable surgery hours can be achieved in a timely manner.With the present approach, surgical procedures can start punctually, inpatient waiting time for surgery and length of stay can be reduced, and staff morale can be enhanced. These improvements will result in cost reduction, and increased hospital revenue without sacrificing the quality of medical care. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

abstract = {Introduction: Anesthetic exposure duration has come under scrutiny because of a Food and Drug Administration warning against prolonged use of anesthesia in children, defined as exposures longer than 3 hours. Methods: Data for 2,613,344 pediatric anesthetic records from the American Society of Anesthesiologist's National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry from 2010 to 2015 were analyzed to describe anesthetic duration and the prevalence of prolonged exposures in children. Common pediatric inpatient procedures were independently assessed to determine factors associated with exposure duration. Results: The overall mean pediatric anesthetic duration was 83.3±107.4 minutes (median, 57 min). Prolonged exposures comprised 7% of pediatric anesthetic records, and 15% of anesthetic records in infants. After restricting to common pediatric inpatient procedures (n=96,603) and adjusting for procedure type using a Poisson model, compared with children 10 years or older, exposures in infants were 20.5% longer (anesthetic duration ratio [ADR], 1.205; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.202-1.208). Longer exposures were also seen with a variety of other patient and hospital factors including ASA 4 patients versus ASA 1 patients, (ADR, 1.381; 95% CI, 1.376-1.386), and university hospitals versus surgery centers (ADR, 1.241; 95% CI, 1.236-1.246). Conclusions: Most pediatric anesthetic exposures last <1 hour with a small percentage lasting over 3 hours. Anesthetic duration for inpatient pediatric procedures, however, is associated with specific patient and hospital characteristics. These results may help identify children potentially at risk for prolonged anesthetic exposure and inform procedure time prediction and operating room scheduling.},

abstract = {Objectives: To develop a methodology for predicting operative times for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) using preoperative patient, disease, procedural, and surgeon variables to facilitate operating room (OR) scheduling. Methods: The model included preoperative metrics: body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists score, clinical stage, National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk, prostate weight, nerve-sparing status, extent and laterality of lymph node dissection, and operating surgeon (six surgeons were included in the study). A binary decision tree was fit using a conditional inference tree method to predict operative times. The variables most associated with operative time were determined using permutation tests. Data were split at the value of the variable that results in the largest difference in mean for surgical time across the split. This process was repeated recursively on the resultant data. Results: A total of 1709 RARPs were included. The variable most strongly associated with operative time was the surgeon (surgeons 2 and 4 - 102 minutes shorter than surgeons 1, 3, 5, and 6, p < 0.001). Among surgeons 2 and 4, BMI had the strongest association with surgical time (p < 0.001). Among patients operated by surgeons 1, 3, 5, and 6, RARP time was again most strongly associated with the surgeon performing RARP. Surgeons 1, 3, and 6 were on average 76 minutes faster than surgeon 5 (p < 0.001). The regression tree output in the form of box plots showed operative time median and ranges according to patient, disease, procedural, and surgeon metrics. Conclusion: We developed a methodology that can predict operative times for RARP based on patient, disease and surgeon variables. This methodology can be utilized for quality control, facilitate OR scheduling, and maximize OR efficiency.},

abstract = {Background: Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (BPM) has shown breast cancer risk reduction in high-risk/BRCA+ patients. However, priority of active cancers coupled with inefficient use of operating room (OR) resources presents challenges in offering BPM in a timely manner. To address these challenges, a rapid access prophylactic mastectomy and immediate reconstruction (RAPMIR) program was innovated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate RAPMIR with regards to access to care and efficiency. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of all high-risk/BRCA+ patients having had BPM between September 2012 and August 2014. Patients were divided into 2 groups: Those managed through the traditional model and those managed through the RAPMIR model. RAPMIR leverages 2 concurrently running ORs with surgical oncology and plastic surgery moving between rooms to complete 3 combined BPMs with immediate reconstruction in addition to 1-2 independent cases each operative day. RAPMIR eligibility criteria included high-risk/BRCA+ status; BPM with immediate, implant-based reconstruction; and day surgery candidacy. Wait times, case volumes and patient throughput were measured and compared. Results: There were 16 traditional patients and 13 RAPMIR patients. Mean wait time (days from referral to surgery) for RAPMIR was significantly shorter than for the traditional model (165.4 v. 309.2 d, p = 0.027). Daily patient throughput (4.3 v. 2.8), plastic surgery case volume (3.7 v. 1.6) and surgical oncology case volume (3.0 v. 2.2) were significantly greater in the RAPMIR model than the traditional model (p = 0.003, p < 0.001 and p = 0.015, respectively). Conclusion: A multidisciplinary model with optimized scheduling has the potential to improve access to care and optimize resource utilization.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to learn about factors that influence the design and implementation of situated computing solutions that support hospital work. This includes social and technical aspects of the actual systems that will be implemented, as well as the appropriate design methodology for developing these systems. Methods: Staff at a surgical department at a University hospital were engaged in a participatory design (PD) process to help solve a problem that was presented by the staff: scheduling of patients and surgery rooms, and creating awareness of the status of ongoing surgeries. The PD process was conceptually aided by a model that describes Medical Informatics Systems as comprising of three components, a service component, a technical component and a social component. The process included the use of ethnographic field work and iterative redesign of both technical and social components of the system after it had been implemented into day-to-day work practice. Results: The PD process resulted in the creation of a system that was iteratively created over a period of about 2 years, and which then handed over to the IT department of the hospital and used by the surgical department for a period of about 1 additional year. The first version of the prototype that was implemented contained usability flaws that made the system difficult to use in time critical situations. As a result of observations and a redesign of the technical component and social component of the system a new version was possible to implement that managed to overcome this problem. A key feature of this second version of the system was that some responsibility for data entry validation was shifted from the technical component of the system to the social component of the system. This was done by allowing users to input poor data initially, while requiring them to fix this data later on. This solution breaks from " traditional" usability design but proved to be quite successful in this case. A challenge with the solution, however, was that the IT department could not understand the concept of systems being described as comprising of both social components and technical components, and thus they had difficulty in understanding the overall design of the system during the handover process. Conclusions: Situated computing can present a number of design challenges that may not be easy for designers and hospital workers to understand before a system has been implemented. Situated computing development may thus need to be aided by PD that includes both ethnographic observations and iterative redesign of the system after it has been implemented. Traditional data validation mechanisms may create poor system performance in cases where users are rushed to input data into the computer due to pressures created by other more critical work activities. In this case it may be better to rely on social mechanisms for correcting errors later on, rather than error catching mechanisms that reject incorrect data. It can be challenging, however, to maintain such systems over time, as IT-departments may lack skills and interest in social components. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Healthcare expenditure is a serious concern, with escalating costs failing to meet the expectations of quality care. The treatment capacities are limited in a hospital setting and the operating rooms (ORs). Their optimal utilization is vital in efficient hospital management. Starting late means considerable wait time for staff, patients and waste of resources. We planned an audit to assess different perspectives of the residents in surgical specialities and anesthesia and OR staff nurses so as to know the causative factors of operative delay. This can help develop a practical model to decrease start time delays in operating room (ORs). Aims: An audit to assess different perspectives of the Operating room (OR) staff with respect to the varied causative factors of operative delay in the OR. To aid in the development of a practical model to decrease start time delays in ORs and facilitate on-time starts at Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma centre (JPNATC), All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi. Methods: We prepared a questionnaire seeking the five main reasons of delay as per their perspective. Results: The available data was analysed. Analysis of the data demonstrated the common causative factors in start time operative delays as: a lack of proper planning, deficiencies in team work, communication gap and limited availability of trained supporting staff. Conclusions: The preparation of the equipment and required material for the OR cases must be done well in advance. Utilization of newer technology enables timely booking and scheduling of cases. Improved inter-departmental coordination and compliance with preanesthetic instructions needs to be ensured. It is essential that the anesthesiologists perform their work promptly, well in time. and supervise the proceedings as the OR manager. This audit is a step forward in defining the need of effective OR planning for continuous quality improvement.},

abstract = {Due to surgery duration variability and arrivals of emergency surgeries, the planned Operating Room (OR) schedule is disrupted throughout the day which may lead to a change in the start time of the elective surgeries. These changes may result in undesirable situations for patients, wards or other involved departments, and therefore, the OR schedule has to be adjusted. In this paper, we develop a decision support system (DSS) which assists the OR manager in this decision by providing the three best adjusted OR schedules. The system considers the preferences of all involved stakeholders and only evaluates the OR schedules that satisfy the imposed resource constraints. The decision rules used for this system are based on a thorough analysis of the OR rescheduling problem. We model this problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) which objective is to minimize the deviation from the preferences of the considered stakeholders. By applying this ILP to instances from practice, we determined that the given preferences mainly lead to (i) shifting a surgery and (ii) scheduling a break between two surgeries. By using these changes in the DSS, the performed simulation study shows that less surgeries are canceled and patients and wards are more satisfied, but also that the perceived workload of several departments increases to compensate this. The system can also be used to judge the acceptability of a proposed initial OR schedule. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Background: Routine predictions made by surgeons or historical mean durations have only limited capacity to predict operating room (OR) time. The authors aimed to devise a prediction model using the surgeon's estimate and characteristics of the surgical team, the operation, and the patient. Methods: Seventeen thousand four hundred twelve consecutive, elective operations from the general surgical department in an academic hospital were analyzed. The outcome was OR time, and the potential predictive factors were surgeon's estimate, number of planned procedures, number and experience of surgeons and anesthesiologists, patient's age and sex, number of previous hospital admissions, body mass index, and eight cardiovascular risk factors. Linear mixed modeling on the logarithm of the total OR time was performed. Results: Characteristics of the operation and the team had the largest predictive performance, whereas patient characteristics had a modest but distinct effect on OR time: operations were shorter for patients older than 60 yr, and higher body mass index was associated with longer OR times. The surgeon's estimate had an independent and substantial contribution to the prediction, and the final model explained 27% of the residual variation in log (OR time). Using the prediction model instead of the surgeon's prediction based on historical averages would reduce shorter-than-predicted and longer-than-predicted OR time by 2.8 and 6.6 min per case (a relative reduction of 12 and 25%, respectively), assessed on independent validation data. Conclusions: Detailed information on the operative session, the team, and the patient substantially improves the prediction of OR times, but the surgeon's estimate remains important. The prediction model may be used in OR scheduling. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies of operating room (OR) information systems data over the past two decades have shown how to predict case durations using the combination of scheduled procedure(s), individual surgeon and assistant(s), and type of anesthetic(s). We hypothesized that the accuracy of case duration prediction could be improved by the use of other electronic medical record data (e.g., patient weight or surgeon notes using standardized vocabularies). METHODS: General thoracic surgery was used as a model specialty because much of its workload is elective (scheduled) and many of its cases are long. PubMed was searched for thoracic surgery papers reporting operative time, surgical time, etc. The systematic literature review identified 48 papers reporting statistically significant differences in perioperative times. RESULTS: There were multiple reports of differences in OR times based on the procedure(s), perioperative team including primary surgeon, and type of anesthetic, in that sequence of importance. All such detail may not be known when the case is originally scheduled and thus may require an updated duration the day before surgery. Although the use of these categorical data from OR systems can result in few historical data for estimating each case's duration, bias and imprecision of case duration estimates are unlikely to be affected. There was a report of a difference in case duration based on additional information. However, the incidence of the procedure for the diagnosis was so uncommon as to be unlikely to affect OR management. CONCLUSIONS: Matching findings of prior studies using OR information system data, multiple case series show that it is important to rely on the precise procedure(s), surgical team, and type of anesthetic when estimating case durations. OR information systems need to incorporate the statistical methods designed for small numbers of prior surgical cases. Future research should focus on the most effective methods to update the prediction of each case's duration as these data become available. The case series did not reveal additional data which could be cost-effectively integrated with OR information systems data to improve the accuracy of predicted durations for general thoracic surgery cases. {\textcopyright} 2008 by International Anesthesia Research Society.},

abstract = {Determining the appropriate amount of block time to allocate to surgeons and selecting the days on which to schedule elective cases can maximize operating room (OR) use. We used computer simulation to model OR scheduling. Inputs in the computer model included different methods to determine when a patient will have surgery (on-line bin-packing algorithms), case durations, lengths of time patients wait for surgery (2 wk is the median longest length of time that the outpatients [n = 367] surveyed considered acceptable), hours of block time each day, and number of blocks each week. For block time to be allocated to maximize OR utilization, two parameters must be specified: the method used to decide on what day a patient will have surgery and the average length of time patients wait to have surgery. OR utilization depends greatly on, and increases as, the average length of time patients wait for surgery increases. Implications: Operating room utilization can be maximized by allocating block time for the elective cases based on expected total hours of elective cases, scheduling patients into the first available date provided open block time is available within 4 wk, and otherwise scheduling patients in 'overflow' time outside of the block time.},

abstract = {Background/Purpose: Elective ambulatory surgical care traditionally involves three independent visits. Single-Visit Surgery (SVS)is an alternative surgical model that consolidates care into one visit. Evaluation of the effect of this novel program on hospital operations is limited. The objective of this study was to analyze SVS from an institutional perspective. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients scheduled for SVS at a freestanding children's hospital between January 2016 and August 2017. Data collected included clinic “no show” rates, operating room (OR)utilization, reimbursement rates, and postoperative visits. Results: There were 89 patients scheduled for SVS, of which 63% (n = 56)were male, and the median age was 6 years [IQR, 4–9]. The SVS clinic “no show” rate was 2% (n = 2)compared to the pediatric surgery clinic “no show” rate of 11% (p = 0.01). The SVS OR block utilization rate was 90%. Payment was received from third-party payors for 92% of consultations and 100% of operative procedures without securing prior authorization. Postoperatively 25% (n = 17)of patients presented to clinic for follow-up, and one child presented to the emergency department for vomiting. There were no hospital admissions. Conclusion: Single-Visit Surgery is an alternative model of ambulatory surgical care that improves institutional efficiency while also enhancing the patient experience.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most operating room (OR) scheduling is done by scheduling personnel based on experience or heuristics. Such often results in excessive overtime for medical personnel and poor resource-use efficiencies. PURPOSE: This study was designed to employ an integrated OR scheduling performance evaluation model (IOSPEM), which integrates quantitative and qualitative multiple objectives, to the improvement of OR scheduling quality. METHODS: The fuzzy Delphi method was used to obtain the weight values of time factor, cost factor, and risk factor. The fuzzy set theory was applied to transform qualitative risk measures into quantitative values. The desirability function was utilized to integrate time, cost, and risk factors to develop the IOSPEM. The simulated annealing algorithm was used to develop the scheduling system and test proposed model performance. RESULTS: The proposed IOSPEM successfully integrated the quantitative and qualitative indices into a sole quantitative index. Experiment results show that the IOSPEM incorporating the simulated annealing algorithm is able to obtain the most efficient OR schedule and is helpful in reducing costs and fatigue risks. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Operating room scheduling will be made more objective and efficient if OR scheduling personnel can simultaneously consider the cost, fatigue risk, and other factors in scheduling. Cost of each OR room should be considered to set appropriate cost coefficients in practical application of the IOSPEM. It is also suggested that other indices (e.g., OR overtime costs and OR nurse fatigue risks) also be considered in the proposed model so as to better reflect the actual scheduling environment.

abstract = {Human resources account for a large part of the budgets of anesthesia and post-anesthesia intensive care units and pain clinics (A-PICU-PC). Adequate staffing is a key factor in providing for both effective care and professional staff development. Changes in professional responsibilities have rendered obsolete the concept of one anesthesiologist per operating room. Duties must be analyzed objectively to facilitate understanding between hospital administrators and A-PICU-PC chiefs of service when assigning human resources. The Catalan Society of Anesthesiology, Post-anesthesia Intensive Care and Pain Therapy has developed a model for estimating requirements for A-PICU-PC staffing based on three factors: 1) Definition of staff positions that must be filled and criteria for assigning human resources; 2) Estimation of non-care-related time required by the department for training, teaching, research and internal management, and 3) Estimation of staff required to cover absences from work for vacations, personal leave or illness. The model revealed that the ratio of number of staff positions to number of persons employed by an A-PICU-PC is approximately 1.3. Differences in the nature of services managed by an A-PICU-PC or the type of hospital might change the ratio slightly. The model can be applied universally, independently of differences that might exist among departments. Widespread application would allow adoption of a common language to be used by health care managers and A-PICU-PC departments when discussing a basis for consensus about our specialty.},

abstract = {Objectives: We sought to develop a risk-adjustment methodology for length of stay in congenital heart surgery, as none exist. Design: Prospective cohort analysis combined with previously obtained retrospective cohort analysis of a Department of Cardiovascular Surgery clinical database. Patients: Patients discharged from Boston Children's Hospital between October 1, 2006, and May 31, 2014, that underwent a congenital heart surgery procedure(s) linked to one of 103 surgical procedure types. Measurements and Main Results: Six thousand two hundred nine discharges during the reporting period at Boston Children's Hospital comprised the cohort. Seven Surgical Length Categories were developed to group surgical procedure types. A multivariable model for outcome length of stay was built using a derivation cohort consisting of a 75% random sample, starting with Surgical Length Categories and considering additional a priori factors. Postoperative factors were then added to improve predictive performance. The remaining 25% of the cohort was used to validate the multivariable models. The coefficient of determination (R2) was used to estimate the variability in length of stay explained by each factor. The Surgical Length Categories yielded an R2 of 42%. Model performance increased when the a priori factors preoperative status, noncardiac abnormality, genetic anomaly, preoperative catheterization during episode of care, weight less than 3 kg, and preoperative vasoactive support medication were introduced to the model (R2 = 60.8%). Model performance further improved when postoperative ventilation greater than 7 days, operating room time, postoperative catheterization during episode of care, postoperative reintubation, number of postoperative vasoactive support medications, postoperative ICU infection, and greater than or equal to one secondary surgical procedure were added (R2 = 76.7%). The validation cohort yielded an R2 of 76.5%. Conclusions: We developed a statistically valid procedure-based categorical variable and multivariable model for length of stay of congenital heart surgeries. The Surgical Length Categories and important a priori and postoperative factors may be used to pursue a predictive tool for length of stay to inform scheduling and bed management practices.},

abstract = {Objective: As academic health centers face increasing financial pressures, they have adopted a more businesslike approach to planning, particularly for discrete "product" or clinical service lines. Since critical care typically has been viewed as a service provided by a hospital, and not a product line, business plans have not historically been developed to expand and promote critical care. The major focus when examining the finances of critical care has been cost reduction, not business development. We hypothesized that a critical care business plan can be developed and analyzed like other more typical product lines and that such a critical care product line can be profitable for an institution. Design: In-depth analysis of critical care including business planning for critical care services. Setting: Regional academic health center in southern New Jersey. Subjects: None. Interventions: As part of an overall business planning process directed by the Board of Trustees, the critical care product line was identified by isolating revenue, expenses, and profitability associated with critical care patients. Measurements and Main Results: We were able to identify the major sources ("value chain") of critical care patients: the emergency room, patients who are admitted for other problems but spend time in a critical care unit, and patients transferred to our intensive care units from other hospitals. The greatest opportunity to expand the product line comes from increasing the referrals from other hospitals. A methodology was developed to identify the revenue and expenses associated with critical cars, based on the analysis of past experience. With this model, we were able to demonstrate a positive contribution margin of $7 million per year related to patients transferred to the institution primarily for critical care services. This can be seen as the profit related to the product line segment of critical care. There was an additional positive contribution margin of $5.8 million attributed to the critical care portion of the hospital stay of patients admitted primarily through other product lines or the emergency room. This can be seen as the profit related to the "hospital service" segment of critical care. This represented a total contribution margin of $12.8 million, approximately 24% of the institution's entire contribution margin. This information was subsequently used to develop strategic plans to promote this product line. Conclusions: We were able to define the critical care product line, and we were able to demonstrate profitability through an analysis of revenue and expenses related to critical care services. Our experience suggests that the concept of critical care as a product line, in addition to a hospital service, may lead to a useful analysis of this new discipline. This plan provided a rational foundation for development of the operating and capital budgets for the health system.},

abstract = {Background: Accurate estimation of operative case-time duration is critical for optimizing operating room use. Current estimates are inaccurate and earlier models include data not available at the time of scheduling. Our objective was to develop statistical models in a large retrospective data set to improve estimation of case-time duration relative to current standards. Study Design: We developed models to predict case-time duration using linear regression and supervised machine learning. For each of these models, we generated an all-inclusive model, service-specific models, and surgeon-specific models. In the latter 2 approaches, individual models were created for each surgical service and surgeon, respectively. Our data set included 46,986 scheduled operations performed at a large academic medical center from January 2014 to December 2017, with 80% used for training and 20% for model testing/validation. Predictions derived from each model were compared with our institutional standard of using average historic procedure times and surgeon estimates. Models were evaluated based on accuracy, overage (case duration > predicted + 10%), underage (case duration < predicted – 10%), and the predictive capability of being within a 10% tolerance threshold. Results: The machine learning algorithm resulted in the highest predictive capability. The surgeon-specific model was superior to the service-specific model, with higher accuracy, lower percentage of overage and underage, and higher percentage of cases within the 10% threshold. The ability to predict cases within 10% improved from 32% using our institutional standard to 39% with the machine learning surgeon-specific model. Conclusions: Our study is a notable advancement toward statistical modeling of case-time duration across all surgical departments in a large tertiary medical center. Machine learning approaches can improve case duration estimations, enabling improved operating room scheduling, efficiency, and reduced costs.},

abstract = {Background: The Operating Room (OR) is a key resource of all major hospitals, but it also accounts for up 40 % of resource costs. Improving cost effectiveness, while maintaining a quality of care, is a universal objective. These goals imply an optimization of planning and a scheduling of the activities involved. This is highly challenging due to the inherent variable and unpredictable nature of surgery. Methods: A Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN 2.0) was used for the representation of the "OR Process" (being defined as the sequence of all of the elementary steps between "patient ready for surgery" to "patient operated upon") as a general pathway ("path"). The path was then both further standardized as much as possible and, at the same time, keeping all of the key-elements that would allow one to address or define the other steps of planning, and the inherent and wide variability in terms of patient specificity. The path was used to schedule OR activity, room-by-room, and day-by-day, feeding the process from a "waiting list database" and using a mathematical optimization model with the objective of ending up in an optimized planning. Results: The OR process was defined with special attention paid to flows, timing and resource involvement. Standardization involved a dynamics operation and defined an expected operating time for each operation. The optimization model has been implemented and tested on real clinical data. The comparison of the results reported with the real data, shows that by using the optimization model, allows for the scheduling of about 30 % more patients than in actual practice, as well as to better exploit the OR efficiency, increasing the average operating room utilization rate up to 20 %. Conclusions: The optimization of OR activity planning is essential in order to manage the hospital's waiting list. Optimal planning is facilitated by defining the operation as a standard pathway where all variables are taken into account. By allowing a precise scheduling, it feeds the process of planning and, further up-stream, the management of a waiting list in an interactive and bi-directional dynamic process.},

(1) To describe the application of a detailed costaccounting method (time-driven activity-cased costing) to operating room personnel costs, avoiding the proxy use of hospital and provider charges. (2) To model potential cost efficiencies using different staffing models with the case study of outpatient adenotonsillectomy. Study Design. Prospective cost analysis case study. Setting. Tertiary pediatric hospital. Subject and Methods. All otolaryngology providers and otolaryngology operating room staff at our institution. Results. Time-driven activity-based costing demonstrated precise per-case and per-minute calculation of personnel costs. We identified several areas of unused personnel capacity in a basic staffing model. Per-case personnel costs decreased by 23.2% by allowing a surgeon to run 2 operating rooms, despite doubling all other staff. Further cost reductions up to a total of 26.4% were predicted with additional staffing rearrangements. Conclusion. Time-driven activity-based costing allows detailed understanding of not only personnel costs but also how personnel time is used. This in turn allows testing of alternative staffing models to decrease unused personnel capacity and increase efficiency},

Objective To introduce a unique rotating hospitalist inpatient program and assess its clinical, educational, and financial impact. The chief of service (COS) program requires 1 attending physician to rotate weekly as chief of the inpatient service with no conflicting elective duties.
Design, Setting, and Participants Thiswas a retrospective internal billing data review performed at a tertiary pediatric hospital. A total of 1241 patients were evaluated by the COS from October 2012 through October 2013.
Interventions All patients were treated by the inpatient service under the supervision of the COS.
Main Outcomes and Measures A retrospective analysis of patient encounters and procedures, including International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, locations of service, clinicians, service dates, and average weekly relative value units (RVUs).
Results Over the study period, the COS was involved in the care of 1241 patients, generating 2786 billable patient encounters. The COS averaged 11.2 patient encounters per day. The most common reasons for consultation were respiratory distress, dysphagia, and stridor. Of patient encounters, 63.0%resulted in a procedure; 82.8%of those procedures were performed in the operating room with the most common being lower airway endoscopy (340 [19.4%]). The average weekly RVUs for the COS (232) were comparable with those of the average weekly outpatient clinic and procedural RVUs of the other otolaryngology faculty in the group (240).
Conclusions And Relevance The COS program was created to meet the clinical, educational, and organizational demands of a high-volume and high-acuity inpatient service. It is a financially sustainable model with unique advantages, particularly for the staff who maintain their outpatient practices without disruption and for the trainees who have the opportunity to work closely with the entire faculty. Patients are provided supervised evaluations and continuity of care. This rotating hospitalist program is a viable alternative to the full-time hospitalist staff model.},

abstract = {Objective: To alleviate the surgical patient flow congestion in the perioperative environment without additional resources. Background: Massachusetts General Hospital experienced increasing overcrowding of the perioperative environment in 2008. The Post-Anesthesia Care Unit would often be at capacity, forcing patients to wait in the operating room. The cause of congestion was traced back to significant variability in the surgical inpatient-bed occupancy across the days of the week due to elective surgery scheduling practices. Methods: We constructed an optimization model to find a rearrangement of the elective block schedule to smooth the average inpatient census by reducing the maximum average occupancy throughout the week. The model was revised iteratively as it was used in the organizational change process that led to an implementable schedule. Results: Approximately 21% of the blocks were rearranged. The setting of study is very dynamic. We constructed a hypothetical scenario to analyze the patient population most representative of the circumstances under which the model was built. For this group, the patient volume remained constant, the average census peak decreased by 3.2% (P < 0.05), and the average weekday census decreased by 2.8% (P < 0.001). When considering all patients, the volume increased by 9%, the census peak increased 1.6% (P < 0.05), and the average weekday census increased by 2% (P < 0.001). Conclusions: This work describes the successful implementation of a datadriven scheduling strategy that increased the effective capacity of the surgical units. The use of the model as an instrument for change and strong managerial leadership was paramount to implement and sustain the new scheduling practices.},

abstract = {Background: Patient and surgical case complexity are important considerations in creating appropriate clinical assignments for trainees in the operating room (OR). The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification System is the most commonly used tool to classify patient illness severity, but it requires manual evaluation by a clinician and is highly variable. A Risk Stratification System for surgical patients was recently published which uses administrative billing codes to calculate four Risk Stratification Indices (RSIs) and provides an objective surrogate for patient complexity that does not require clinical evaluation. This risk score could be helpful when assigning operating room cases. Objective: This is a technical feasibility study to evaluate the process and potential utility of incorporating an automatic risk score calculation into a web-based tool for assigning OR cases. Methods: We created a web service implementation of the RSI model for one-year mortality and automatically calculated the RSI values for patients scheduled to undergo an operation the following day. An analysis was conducted on data availability for the RSI model and the correlation between RSI values and ASA physical status. Results: In a retrospective analysis of 46,740 patients who received surgery in the year preceding the web tool implementation, RSI values were generated for 20,638 patients (44%). The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between ASA physical status classification and one-year mortality RSI values was 0.404. Conclusions: We have shown that it is possible to create a web-based tool that uses existing billing data to automatically calculate risk scores for patients scheduled to undergo surgery. Such a risk scoring system could be used to match patient acuity to physician experience, and to provide improved patient and clinician experiences. The web tool could be improved by expanding the input database or utilizing procedure booking codes rather than billing data. {\textcopyright} Schattauer 2013.},

abstract = {Background: Previous research has identified 2 psychological biases in operating room (OR) decisions on the day of surgery: risk attitude of the decision-maker at the OR control desk and decisions made by OR staff to increase clinical work per unit time during the hours they are assigned. Resulting decisions are worse than random chance at reducing overutilized time. To isolate the second bias from decisions at the OR control desk, previous studies of the second bias have analyzed decisions made in non-OR locations and on nights/weekends. Another way to isolate the second bias from decisions at the OR control desk is to study facilities with negligible overutilized OR time. We examined the second bias using data from such a facility. Methods: One year of data was collected from a 5-OR hospital. Allocated OR time that minimized the inefficiency of use of OR time was determined first to confirm there was virtually no overutilized OR time. A structural equation model was then built to evaluate the relations among variables while controlling for other correlations. We tested the hypothesis that nonoperative times were no longer on days with little versus relatively large workload. RESULTS: The extra ORs were not cost efficient (i.e., the mean potential improvement varied among days from 21.1% ± 0.2% [SE] to 38.9% ± 0.2%), resulting in very little overutilized OR time. However, conditioned on the preceding tactical decision of running extra ORs, the allocated OR time during the studied period was that which minimized the inefficiency of use of OR time. As the preceding results showed that the facility was suitable for the behavioral study, the behavioral study was performed, and the hypothesized relation confirmed. Each 1-hour decrease in the daily estimated (total) duration of elective cases resulted in a managerially unimportant decrease in the mean turnover times (0.41 ± 0.21 minutes, P = 0.053). Excluding turnovers when there were >2 turnovers occurring simultaneously, there was no significant decrease (0.17 ± 0.24 minutes, P = 0.464) in the mean turnover times per each 1-hour decrease in the daily estimated (total) duration. Similarly, after excluding prolonged turnovers (>60 minutes), there was no significant decrease (0.16 ± 0.16 minutes, P = 0.315) in the mean turnover times per each 1-hour decrease in the daily estimated (total) duration. CONCLUSIONS: Previous experimental and observational studies found many clinicians maintained high clinical work per unit time during the hours to which they were assigned. We tested and confirmed a prediction of this bias as was applied during regularly scheduled OR hours among an entire surgical team. Overall, the staff worked just as quickly on days with few or many hours of cases. The OR staff did not slow down, thus filling the time. These results have important implications for the cost utility of information technologies to facilitate managerial decision-making on the day of surgery. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Anesthesia Research Society.},

abstract = {We present a two-phase model for a staff planning problem in a surgical department. We consider the setting where staff, in particular nurse circulators and surgical scrub technicians, are assigned to one of different service lines, and while they can be ‘pooled' and temporally assigned to other service line if needed, these re-assignments should belimited. In Phase I, we decide on the number of staff hours to budget for each service line, considering policies limiting staff pooling and overtime, and different demand scenarios. In Phase II, we determine how these budgeted staff hours should be allocated across potential work days and shifts, given estimated staff requirements and shift-related scheduling restrictions. We propose a heuristic to speed the model's Phase II solution time. We implement the model using a hospital's surgical data and compare the model's results with the hospital's current practices. Using a simulation model for the surgical operations, we find that our two-phase model reduces the delays caused by staff unavailability as well as staff pooling, without increasing the workforce size. Finally, we briefly describe a decision-support tool we developed with the objective of fine-tuning staff planning decisions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Consider a case that has been ongoing for longer than the scheduled duration. The anesthesiologist estimates that there is 1 hour remaining. Forty-five minutes later the case has not yet finished, and closure has not yet started. We showed previously that the mean (expected) time remaining is approximately 1 hour, not 15 minutes. The relationship is a direct mathematical consequence of the log-normal probability distributions of operating room (OR) case durations. We test the hypothesis that, with an accurate probabilistic model, until closure begins the estimated mean time remaining would be the mean time from the start of closure to OR exit. METHODS: Among the 311,940 OR cases in a 7-year time series from 1 hospital, there were 3962 cases for which (1) there had been previously at least 30 cases of the same combination of scheduled procedure(s), surgeon, and type of anesthetic and (2) the actual OR time exceeded the 0.9 quantile of case duration before the case started. A Bayesian statistical method was used to calculate the mean (expected) minutes remaining in the case at the 0.9 quantile. The estimate was compared with the actual minutes from the time of the start of closure until the patient exited the OR. RESULTS: The mean ± standard error of the pairwise difference was 0.2 ± 0.4 minutes. The Bayesian estimate for the 0.9 quantile was exceeded by 10.2% ± 0.01% of cases (i.e., very close to the desired 10.0% rate). CONCLUSIONS: If a case is taking longer than the expected (scheduled) duration, closure has not yet started, and someone in the OR is asked how much time the case likely has remaining, the value recorded on a clipboard for viewing later should be the estimated time remaining (e.g., "1 hour") not an end time (e.g., "5:15 PM"). Electronic whiteboard displays should not show that the estimated time remaining in the case is less than the mean time from start of closure to OR exit. Similarly, if closure has started, the expected time remaining that is displayed should not be longer than the mean time from closure to OR exit. Finally, our results match previous reports that, before a case starts, statistical methods can reliably be used to assist in decisions involving the longest amount of time that cases may take (e.g., conflict checking for resources, filling holes in the OR schedule, and preventing holes in the schedule).

abstract = {Background: Medical institutions are under increased economic pressure to schedule elective surgeries efficiently to contain the costs of surgical services. Surgical scheduling is complicated by variability inherent in the duration of surgical procedures. Modeling that variability, in turn, provides a mechanism to generate accurate time estimates. Accurate time estimates are important operationally to improve operating room utilization and strategically to identify surgeons, procedures, or patients whose duration of surgeries differ from what might be expected. Methods: The authors retrospectively studied 40,076 surgical cases (1,580 Current Procedural Terminology-anesthesia combinations, each with a case frequency of five or more) from a large teaching hospital, and attempted to determine whether the distribution of surgical procedure times more closely fit a normal or a log- normal distribution. The authors tested goodness-of-fit to these data for both models using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Reasons, in practice, the Shapiro- Wilk test may reject the fit of a log-normal model when in fact it should be retained were also evaluated. Results: The Shapiro-Wilk test indicates that the log-normal model is superior to the normal model for a large and diverse set of surgeries. Goodness-of-fit tests may falsely reject the log-normal model during certain conditions that include rounding errors in procedure times, large sample sizes, untrimmed outliers, and heterogeneous mixed populations of surgical procedure times. Conclusions: The authors recommend use of the log-normal model for predicting surgical procedure times for Current Procedural Terminology-anesthesia combinations. The results help to legitimize the use of log transforms to normalize surgical procedure times before hypothesis testing using linear statistical models or other parametric statistical tests to investigate factors affecting the duration of surgeries.},

abstract = {Background: Variability in surgical procedure times increases the cost of healthcare delivery by increasing both the underutilization and overutilization of expensive surgical resources. To reduce variability in surgical procedure times, we must identify and study its sources. Methods: Our data set consisted of all surgeries performed over a 7-yr period at a large teaching hospital, resulting in 46,322 surgical cases. To study factors associated with variability in surgical procedure times, data mining techniques were used to segment and focus the data so that the analyses would be both technically and intellectually feasible. The data were subdivided into 40 representative segments of manageable size and variability based on headers adopted from the common procedural terminology classification. Each data segment was then analyzed using a main-effects linear model to identify and quantify specific sources of variability in surgical procedure times. Results: The single most important source of variability in surgical procedure times was surgeon effect. Type of anesthesia, age, gender, and American Society of Anesthesiologists risk class were additional sources of variability. Intrinsic case-specific variability, unexplained by any of the preceding factors, was found to be highest for shorter surgeries relative to longer procedures. Variability in procedure times among surgeons was a multiplicative function (proportionate to time) of surgical time and total procedure time, such that as procedure times increased, variability in surgeons' surgical time increased proportionately. Conclusions: Surgeon- specific variability should be considered when building scheduling heuristics for longer surgeries. Results concerning variability in surgical procedure times due to factors such as type of anesthesia, age, gender, and American Society of Anesthesiologists risk class may be extrapolated to scheduling in other institutions, although specifics on individual surgeons may not. This research identifies factors associated with variability in surgical procedure times, knowledge of which may ultimately be used to improve surgical scheduling and operating room utilization.},

abstract = {Objective: Analytical techniques are being implemented with increasing frequency to improve the management of surgical departments and to ensure that decisions are well informed. Often these analytical techniques rely on the validity of underlying statistical assumptions, including those around choice of distribution when modelling uncertainty. The aim of the present study was to determine a set of suitable statistical distributions and provide recommendations to assist hospital planning staff, based on three full years of historical data. Methods: Statistical analysis was performed to determine the most appropriate distributions and models in a variety of surgical contexts. Data from 2013 to 2015 were collected from the surgical department at a large Australian public hospital. Results: A log-normal distribution approximation of the total duration of surgeries in an operating room is appropriate when considering probability of overtime. Surgical requests can be modelled as a Poisson process with rate dependent on urgency and day of the week. Individual cancellations could be modelled as Bernoulli trials, with the probability of patient-, staff-and resource-based cancellations provided herein. Conclusions: The analysis presented herein can be used to ensure that assumptions surrounding planning and scheduling in the surgical department are valid. Understanding the stochasticity in the surgical department may result in the implementation of more realistic decision models. What is known about the topic?: Many surgical departments rely on crude estimates and general intuition to predict surgical duration, surgical requests (both elective and non-elective) and cancellations. What does this paper add?: This paper describes how statistical analysis can be performed to validate common assumptions surrounding surgical uncertainty. The paper also provides a set of recommended distributions and associated parameters that can be used to model uncertainty in a large public hospital's surgical department. What are the implications for practitioners?: The insights on surgical uncertainty provided here will prove valuable for administrative staff who want to incorporate uncertainty in their surgical planning and scheduling decisions.},

@article{Shi2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In previous studies, hospitals' operating room (OR) schedules were influenced markedly by decisions made within a few days of surgery. At an academic hospital, 46% of ORs had their last case scheduled or changed within 1 working day of surgery, and a private hospital had 64%. Many of these changes were for patients who were admitted before surgery (i.e., inpatient cases). In this study, we investigate the impact on OR productivity of how cases are scheduled within 1 working day before the day of surgery. METHODS: We consider the case-scheduling choice between 2 ORs. We compare 3 scheduling policies: Best Fit Descending, Worst Fit Descending, and Worst Fit Ascending. "Descending" strategies consider new cases from longest to shortest, whereas "Ascending" considers new cases from shortest to longest. Best Fit schedules each new case into the OR with sufficient but the least remaining underutilized OR time for the case. Worst Fit does the same but with the most remaining time. For our application, Best Fit chooses a later start time, whereas Worst Fit chooses an earlier start time. In our computational model, cases are of 2 possible durations, brief or long. Case cancellation is incorporated explicitly, and the number of new cases to schedule depends on the current number of scheduled cases in each OR, both new from previous studies. The number of cases in each OR is modeled as a Markov chain, evolving between 2 periods, corresponding to 1 day and 0 days before the day of surgery. For each scheduling policy, we evaluate the mean overutilized OR time and productivity. Our sensitivity analyses cover many cancellation rates, arrival settings, case durations, and initial conditions (i.e., how cases are scheduled into the 2 ORs preceding 1 workday before the day of surgery). RESULTS: Best Fit Descending and Worst Fit Descending achieved almost the same overutilized time and productivity. Worst Fit Ascending caused greater overutilized time (as much as 6.6 minutes more per OR) and thus lesser productivity (as much as 1.6% less) compared with Best Fit Descending or Worst Fit Descending. When the staff were scheduled for less time than the optimal allocated OR time, there were nearly the same differences between the staff productivity resulting from the use of Worst Fit Ascending rather than Worst Fit Descending or Best Fit Descending. CONCLUSIONS: Scheduling office decision making within 1 day before surgery should be based on statistical forecasts of expected total OR workload (i.e., forecasts that include the addition of non-elective cases and the subtraction of cases that cancel). As long as a case is not scheduled into overutilized time when less overutilized time could be achieved in another OR, and cases are considered in descending sequence of scheduled durations, the differences in overutilized time and productivity among the scheduling policies are small. Cognitive bias in staff scheduling causes a significant reduction in productivity, but the differences among scheduling policies are nearly the same as when there is no bias.},

abstract = {Background: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) duty-hour requirements prompted program directors to rethink the organizational structure of their residency programs. Many surgical educators have expressed concerns that duty-hour restrictions would negatively affect quality of resident education. This article summarizes evaluation research results collected to study the impact of our reengineered residency program designed to preserve important educational activities while meeting duty-hour accreditation requirements. Study Design: The traditional residency structure was redesigned to include a mixture of apprenticeship, small team, and night-float models. Impact evaluation data were collected using operative case logs, standardized test scores, quality assurance data, resident perception surveys, a faculty survey, and process evaluation measures. Results: PGY1s and PGY2s enjoyed a substantial increase in operative cases. Operative cases increased overall and no resident has failed to meet ACGME volume or distribution requirements. American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination performance improved for PGY1s and PGY2s. Patient outcomes measures, including monthly mortality and number of and charges for admissions, showed no changes. Anonymously completed rotation evaluation forms showed stable or improved resident perceptions of case load, continuity, operating room teaching, appropriate level of faculty involvement and supervision, encouragement to attend conferences, and general assessment of the learning environment. A quality-of-life survey completed by residents before and after implementation of the new program structure showed substantial improvements. Faculty surveys showed perceived increases in work hours and job dissatisfaction. New physician assistant and nurse positions directly attributed to duty-hour restrictions amounted to about 0.2 full-time equivalent per resident. Conclusions: Duty-hour restrictions produce new challenges and might require additional resources but need not cause a deterioration of surgical residents' educational experience. {\textcopyright} 2007 American College of Surgeons.},

abstract = {Purpose of reviewAlthough the NORA setting continues to outgrow the main operating room in cases, there are few studies addressing efficiency metrics, and even fewer studies addressing those of a single specialty outpatient gastroenterology facility. In order to capitalize on this growing trend, gastrointestinal endoscopies must be scheduled in a way that prevents lost potential revenue while maintaining patient convenience, comfort, safety, and satisfaction. By standardizing our scheduling for procedure block time among various endoscopists and converting our sedation practices from conscious sedation to solely Propofol sedation in a 4:1 CRNA to Anesthesiologist model, we increased revenue while maximizing physician efficiency and site utilization.Recent findingsThe commonly used main operating room efficiency benchmarks cannot effectively be applied in NORA as these two locations have widely different procedure times, turn-around-times, and recovery times. In fact, procedures in gastrointestinal endoscopy suites can be completed in less time than a typical operating room takes for turnover.SummaryBy adapting our sedation practices to solely Propofol sedation and by standardizing our procedural schedule times among all the endoscopists, we maximized the number of cases and revenue in our outpatient gastrointestinal endoscopy suite while increasing patient satisfaction through reduction in overall patient facility time and procedure to discharge time.},

abstract = {Rationale, aims and objectives What factors determine the use of an anaesthesia preparation room and shorten non-operative time? Methods A logistic regression is applied to 18 751 surgery records from AZ Sint-Jan Brugge AV, Belgium, where each operating room has its own anaesthesia preparation room. Surgeries, in which the patient's induction has already started when the preceding patient's surgery has ended, belong to a first group where the preparation room is used as an induction room. Surgeries not fulfilling this property belong to a second group. A logistic regression model tries to predict the probability that a surgery will be classified into a specific group. Non-operative time is calculated as the time between end of the previous surgery and incision of the next surgery. A log-linear regression of this non-operative time is performed. Results It was found that switches in surgeons, being a non-elective surgery as well as the previous surgery being non-elective, increase the probability of being classified into the second group. Only a few surgery types, anaesthesiologists and operating rooms can be found exclusively in one of the two groups. Analysis of variance demonstrates that the first group has significantly lower non-operative times. Switches in surgeons, anaesthesiologists and longer scheduled durations of the previous surgery increases the non-operative time. A switch in both surgeon and anaesthesiologist strengthens this negative effect. Only a few operating rooms and surgery types influence the non-operative time. Conclusion The use of the anaesthesia preparation room shortens the non-operative time and is determined by several human and structural factors.},

abstract = {Background: In recent years, there are many studies on scheduling methods of patient flow, nurse scheduling, bed allocation, operating room scheduling and other problems, but there is no report on the research methods of how to plan ward allocation from a more macroscopic perspective. Objective: Refine and stratify the obstetric ward to provide more accurate medical service for pregnant women and improve the work efficiency of obstetricians and midwives. The problem of how to allocate the number of each type of ward is modeled as a mixed integer programming problem, which maximizes the patient flow of pregnant women in obstetric hospitals. Methods: The obstetric wards are divided into observation ward, cesarean section ward and natural delivery ward according to lean thinking. CPLEX is used to solve the mixed-integer programming problem of ward allocation. In R software, multivariate Generalized Linear Models (GLM) regression model is used to analyze the influence of each factor on patient flow. Results: The maximum patient flow of each case was obtained by CPLEX, which was 19-25% higher than that of patients without refinement, stratification and planning. GLM regression analysis was carried out on the abovementioned data, and the positive and negative correlation factors were obtained. Conclusion: According to lean thinking, obstetric wards are divided into three types of wards. Obstetricians and midwives work more efficiently and get more rest time. Pregnant women also enjoy more detailed medical services. By modeling the delivery ward allocation problem as a mixed-integer programming problem, we can improve the capacity of the service in obstetric hospitals from a macro perspective. Through GLM regression model analysis, it is conducive to improve the obstetric hospital capacity from the perspective of positive and negative correlation factors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Perception of turnovers may be influenced less by actual turnover times per se than by a mental model of factors influencing turnover times. METHODS: A survey was performed at a U.S. academic hospital in 2010. Each of the 78 subjects estimated characteristics of his/her turnover times in 2009. Responses were compared with the actual times. RESULTS: Numbers of comments were not proportional to actual total waiting times experienced. Surgeons with 2 or more comments (n = 10) averaged the same numbers of turnovers as did surgeons who made 1 or no comments (n = 13) (P = 0.62). Four of the 10 surgeons with 2 or more comments averaged <2 turnovers per month ("very few turnovers"). Perceptions of turnover times were influenced by opinion about team activity during shift change. Most (>79%) subjects thought that the time of the day with the subject's largest number of prolonged (>45 minutes) turnovers was at least 2 hours later than actual (P < 0.0001). Although most prolonged turnovers occurred around noon, 8 surgeons mentioned shift change qualitatively, and most (68%, P = 0.002) subjects estimated a time overlapping with shift change. Surgeons overall overestimated their observed percentage of prolonged turnovers (P = 0.020), and anesthesiologists' estimates were overall unbiased. Surgeons' bias cannot be explained by knowing times of a longer interval such as "skin to skin," because the other surgeons, with very few turnovers, had responses that were essentially identical (P ≥ 0.87). When we corrected for each subject's actual mean turnover time, surgeons' estimates for their averages were longer than were anesthesiologists' estimates (P = 0.002). Responses were again essentially indistinguishable from those of subjects with very few turnovers (P ≥ 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: Managers should not rely on surgeons or anesthesiologists for their expert judgment on turnover times. Managers should also not interpret comments about turnover times as literally referring to the time, but instead as factors perceived as contributing to the time (e.g., attitude about the facility and the activity of its personnel).

Operating theatre is the bottleneck and costliest department. Therefore, the surgery scheduling is crucial to hospital management. OBJECTIVE: To increase the utilization and reduce the cost of operating theatre, and to improve surgeons' satisfaction in the meantime, a practical surgery scheduling which could assign the operating room (OR) and surgeon for the surgery and sequence surgeries in each OR was provided for hospital managers. METHODS: Surgery durations were predicted by fitting the distributions. A two-step mixed integer programming model considering surgery duration uncertainty was proposed, and sample average approximation (SAA) method was applied to solve the model. RESULTS: Durations of various surgeries were log-normal distributed respectively. Numerical experiments showed the model and method could get good solutions with different sample sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Real-life constraints and duration uncertainty were considered in the study, and the model was also very applicable in practice. Average overtime of each OR was reducing and tending to be stable with the number of surgeons increasing, which is a discipline for OR management.},

abstract = {Many healthcare institutions are interested in reducing costs and in maintaining a good quality of care. The operating room department is typically one of the most costly units in a hospital. Hospital managers are always interested in finding effective ways of using operating rooms to minimize operating costs. In this research, we study the operating room scheduling problem. We consider the use of a weekly surgery schedule with an open scheduling strategy that takes into account the availabilities of surgeons and operating rooms. The objective is to minimize the total operating cost while maximizing the utilization of the operating rooms but also minimizing overtime use. A revised mathematical model is proposed that can provide optimal solutions for a surgery size up to 110 surgical cases. Next, two modified heuristics, based on the earliest due date (EDD) and longest processing time (LPT) rules, are proposed to quickly find feasible solutions to the studied problem. Finally, an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm that incorporates the initial solutions, a recovery scheme, local search schemes, and an elitism strategy is proposed. The computational results show that, for a surgery size between 40 and 100 surgical cases, the ABC algorithm found optimal solutions to all of the tested problems. For surgery sizes larger than 110 surgical cases, the ABC algorithm performed significantly better than the two proposed heuristics. The computational results indicate that the proposed ABC is promising and capable of solving large problems.},

Methods: A discrete-event computer model of the emergency room and related hospital facilities was constructed and implemented, based on cumulated data from 12 urban terrorist bombing incidents in Israel. Results: The simulation predicts that the admitting capacity of the hospital depends primarily on the number of available surgeons and defines an optimal staff profile for surgeons, residents, and trauma nurses. The major bottlenecks in the flow of critical casualties are the shock rooms and the computed tomographic scanner but not the operating rooms. The simulation also defines the number of reinforcement staff needed to treat noncritical casualties and shows that radiology is the major obstacle to the flow of these patients. Conclusion: Computer simulation is an important new tool for the optimization of surgical service elements for a multiple-casualty situation.},

abstract = {Introduction Hospital length of stay (LOS) contributes to costs. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is performed frequently by vascular surgeons, making contemporary CEA LOS rates and predictors vital knowledge for quality evaluation and cost containment initiatives. Methods Using a prospective single-institution database, we retrospectively identified consecutive patients undergoing CEA from 2001 to 2011. Demographic and perioperative factors were prospectively collected. The primary end point was extended postoperative LOS (ELOS), defined as postoperative LOS ≥2 days. Factors associated with ELOS were analyzed in a multivariable logistic regression model. Rates of 1-year readmission and death were compared with the Kaplan-Meier method (log-rank test). Results Eight hundred forty patients underwent 897 CEAs with 39% of procedures among females and 35% for symptomatic disease. One hundred two (11.4%) patients were inpatients prior to the day of CEA (" preadmitted"); their preoperative days by definition are not included in ELOS. Median postoperative LOS was 1 day (interquartile range, 1-2). Four hundred fourteen patients (46.2%) had ELOS. Preadmission was associated with ELOS (72% vs 41%; P <.01) and ELOS patients were less likely to be discharged home (11.9% vs 1.5%; P <.01). There was no association between ELOS and unplanned 30-day postdischarge readmission (6.0% vs 7.0%; P =.59). On multivariable analysis, preoperative factors significantly associated with ELOS included preadmission (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-5.7; P <.001), history of congestive heart failure (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-4.2; P =.03), female gender (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.6; P <.001), and history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-2.9; P =.04). Operative factors included electroencephalography change (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.2; P =.01), operating room start time after 12:00 pm (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4; P <.01), and total operating room time (OR, 1.5 per hour; 95% CI, 1.2-2.9; P <.01). Postoperative factors included transfer to intensive care unit (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.1-9.4; P <.01), number of in-hospital postoperative complications (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.2-6.5; P <.01), and Foley catheter placement (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3-3.4; P <.01). Over 1 year, ELOS was associated with increased hospital readmission (93.6% vs 84.7%; log-rank test, P <.01) and decreased survival (95.1% vs 98.3%; log-rank test, P <.01). Conclusions Nearly half of CEA patients were discharged on or after postoperative day 2. Interventions on modifiable risk factors, such as early Foley catheter placement to prevent urinary retention and morning CEA scheduling, may decrease LOS. ELOS may identify a subset of patients at increased risk for long-term readmission and mortality. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 by the Society for Vascular Surgery.},

abstract = {Objective: Effective time and resource management in the operating room requires process information concerning the surgical procedure being performed. A major parameter relevant to the intraoperative process is the remaining intervention time. The work presented here describes an approach for the prediction of the remaining intervention time based on surgical low-level tasks. Materials and methods: A surgical process model optimized for time prediction was designed together with a prediction algorithm. The prediction accuracy was evaluated for two different neurosurgical interventions: discectomy and brain tumor resections. A repeated random sub-sampling validation study was conducted based on 20 recorded discectomies and 40 brain tumor resections. Results: The mean absolute error of the remaining intervention time predictions was 13. min 24. s for discectomies and 29. min 20. s for brain tumor removals. The error decreases as the intervention progresses. Discussion: The approach discussed allows for the on-line prediction of the remaining intervention time based on intraoperative information. The method is able to handle demanding and variable surgical procedures, such as brain tumor resections. A randomized study showed that prediction accuracies are reasonable for various clinical applications. Conclusion: The predictions can be used by the OR staff, the technical infrastructure of the OR, and centralized management. The predictions also support intervention scheduling and resource management when resources are shared among different operating rooms, thereby reducing resource conflicts. The predictions could also contribute to the improvement of surgical workflow and patient care. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The problem of minimizing associated labor costs (both under and over utilization) can be converted to the problem of least absolute deviation regression. The dependent variables are the times to complete series of cases. The independent variables are the numbers of cases in each series that are in various categories (i.e., combinations of scheduled procedures and surgeons).

abstract = {Purpose: The individual scheduling of the operating rooms (ORs) has a significant influence on postoperative care at hospital facilities. We studied the effect of incorporating postoperative departments in the decision process with regard to scheduling ORs and developed an integrated OR planning methodology that determines an optimal surgery sequence and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) nursing staff level, with the objective to level the variability in inflow of patients in the PACU. Design: We developed an integrated OR planning methodology that investigates the sequencing of a surgical suite process with multiple ORs and postoperative hospital facilities. Methods: This research was performed by representing a discrete-time two-stage flow shop problem. A retrospective study was performed in which the derived model was validated using discrete-event simulation. Findings: Simulation results show that applying the integrated planning methodology decreased the variability in bed demand and smoothed the workload for the nursing staff in the PACU. Moreover, applying the algorithm led to a decrease in PACU completion time and a reduced amount of overtime hours for the surgical suite. Based on our results, we derived simple scheduling guidelines. Conclusions: Our simulation results confirmed the hypothesis that prospectively sequencing ORs' cases can effectively decrease the variability in bed demand and smoothen the workload for the staff personnel. Moreover, applying the algorithm leads to a decrease in PACU completion time and less overtime hours for the surgical suite. As such, an integrated OR planning methodology facilitates hospitals in improving OR efficiency.},

abstract = {The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) mandates minimum numbers of cases in many specialties, including anesthesiology, but resident scheduling is often done on the basis of time spent on each rotation rather the number of opportunities for specific cases, risking uneven case distribution, particularly for low-volume cases. We used the neuroanesthesia rotation as a model to evaluate a system to more evenly distribute ACGME-mandated cases among residents and assessed the effects on their perceptions of their experience on the rotation. In November 2018, we instituted a targeted operating room scheduling system at our institution by making specific daily assignment requests for anesthesia residents on the neuroanesthesia rotation. We used Shewhart control charts to analyze the variation in case distribution among all resident rotations (N = 91) from January 2018 to October 2019. We then surveyed residents who had experienced both systems (n = 15) and those who had experienced only the old system (n = 16). Shewhart p-charts of the proportion of ACGME-mandated cases assigned to each resident showed wide variation under the old scheduling system and a more even distribution under the new system. Residents reported significantly greater perceived fairness of case distribution and balance between their education and service obligations under the new system (response rates: 10/16 [62.5%] and 13/15 [86.7%]). Targeted resident scheduling based on ACGME-mandated case numbers rather than solely time spent on a rotation is feasible and can improve resident perceptions of fairness and balance between education and service, a top priority of the ACGME.},

Urgent trauma cases were defined as those taken to the OR within 30 minutes of arrival. In one model the OR was available 24 hours a day with in-hospital personnel. The second model used an out-of-hospital call schedule, assuming a patient-ready OR in 30 minutes. Costs and revenue per urgent case were calculated. A break-even analysis shows the number of cases required for costs to equal revenue. Results: In the 24-hour model, the cost/urgent case is $14,288; in the call-schedule model $3,243. The number of cases to break even in the 24-hour model is 1210; in the call-schedule model 375. Conclusions: A call-schedule model is the least costly way to staff an OR for urgent trauma cases.},

abstract = {Objective: Over the past decade, our institution has instituted three different scheduling models in an attempt to care for pediatric trauma at our Level I Trauma Center. This has been in response to a number of factors, including a limited number of physicians covering the call schedule, increasing competition for operating room (OR) time after hours (pediatric surgery, urology, neurosurgery), an attempt to fully utilize OR time during the daytime, fully staffed hours, and optimizing patients' timeliness to surgery. We examined the three on-call systems in place at our institution to determine whether a more flexible approach to pediatric trauma call resulted in delays in treatment. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patient records for three distinct 1-year periods with three different surgical call schedules: (i) a traditional call schedule in which the call physician was responsible for patients who presented to our emergency room; (ii) a half-day trauma block OR reserved the morning following call; and (iii) a full-day trauma block. Variables included date of injury, time of admission, admission diagnosis, cause of injury, and OR procedure and start time. Results: We reviewed 951 cases over the entire study, 268 during the traditional call schedule, 282 during the half-call block and 401 over the time period of the full-day block. Mechanisms of injury were similar among the three groups, with falls and motor vehicle accidents being the leading causes. The average delay time was 17:40 for the traditional call group, 15:10 for the half-block call group, and 15:09 for the full-day block group. Our findings suggest that there was a high incidence of cases performed on weekdays after peak staffing hours with a traditional call model (59%). In contrast, half-day and full-day block models saw only 4% and 1% of the cases performed after peak staffing hours, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of patients admitted to the OR among the three groups ($\chi$2 = 488.8449, P < 0.0001). The number of patients seen during Monday through Friday was also statistically significant among the three groups ($\chi$2 = 382.0576, P < 0.0001). Conclusions: The institution of more flexible and physician-directed half-call and full-day blocks did result in delays in treatment. However, it also has demonstrated benefits to patients in reducing the number of operative cases performed after weekday peak staffing hours; helped our institution better manage its staffing and financial resources; and provided the treating surgeon flexibility in determining the timing of operative care.},

abstract = {Background: Length-of-stay prediction for cardiac surgery patients is a key point for medical management issues, such as optimization of resources in intensive care units and operating room scheduling. Scoring systems are a very attractive family of predictive models, but their retraining and updating are generally critical. The present approach to designing a scoring system for predicting length of stay in intensive care aims to overcome these difficulties, so that a model designed in a given scenario can easily be adjusted over time or for internal purposes. Methods: A na{\"{i}}ve Bayes approach was used to develop a simple scoring system. A set of 36 preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative variables collected in a sample of 3256 consecutive adult patients undergoing heart surgery were considered as likely risk predictors. The number of variables was reduced by selecting an optimal subset of features. Scoring system performance was assessed by cross-validation. Results: After the selection process, seven variables were entered in the prediction model, which showed excellent discrimination, good generalization power and suitable sensitivity and specificity. No significant difference was found between AUC of the training and testing sets. The 95% confidence interval for AUC estimated by the BCa bootstrap method was [0.841, 0.883] and [0.837, 0.880] in the training and testing sets, respectively. Chronic dialysis, low postoperative cardiac output and acute myocardial infarction proved to be the major risk factors. Conclusions: The proposed approach produced a simple and trustworthy scoring system, which is easy to update regularly and to customize for other centers. This is a crucial point when scoring systems are used as predictive models in clinical practice.},

Materials and Methods An administrative dataset was used to compute time intervals required for various preprocedural patient-flow processes. These time intervals were compared across on-time/delayed cases and inpatient/outpatient cases by Mann–Whitney U test. Spearman $\rho$ was used to assess any correlation of the rank of a procedure on a given day and the procedure duration to the preprocedure time. A linear-regression model of preprocedure time was used to further explore potential contributing factors. Any identified reason(s) for delay were collated. P <.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Of the total 1,091 cases, 65.8% (n = 718) were delayed. Significantly more outpatient cases started late compared with inpatient cases (81.4% vs 45.0%; P <.001, $\chi$2 test). The multivariate linear regression model showed outpatient status, length of delay in arrival, and longer procedure times to be significantly associated with longer preprocedure times. Late arrival of patients (65.9%), unavailability of physicians (18.4%), and unavailability of procedure room (13.0%) were the three most frequently identified reasons for delay. The delay was multifactorial in 29.6% of cases (n = 213). Conclusions Objective measurement of preprocedural IR patient flow demonstrated considerable waste and highlighted high-yield areas of possible improvement.

abstract = {Surgery is one of the key functions in hospitals; it generates significant revenue and admissions to hospitals. In this paper we address the decision of choosing a case-mix for a surgery department. The objective of this study is to generate an optimal case-mix plan of surgery patients with uncertain surgery operations, which includes uncertainty in surgery durations, length of stay, surgery demand and the availability of nurses. In order to obtain an optimal case-mix plan, a stochastic optimization model is proposed and the sample average approximation method is applied. The proposed model is used to determine the number of surgery cases to be weekly served, the amount of operating rooms' time dedicated to each specialty and the number of ward beds dedicated to each specialty. The optimal case-mix selection criterion is based upon a weighted score taking into account both the waiting list and the historical demand of each patient category. The score aims to maximizing the service level of the operating rooms by increasing the total number of surgery cases that could be served. A computational experiment is presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the stochastic model solution outperforms the expected value problem solution. Additional analysis is conducted to study the effect of varying the number of ORs and nurses capacity on the overall ORs' performance.},

Reserving Operating Room (OR) capacity is a common technique to maximize the responsiveness of an OR in case of arrival of an emergency patient. This study determines the best way to reserve OR time for emergency surgery. In this study two approaches of reserving capacity were compared: (1) concentrating all reserved OR capacity in dedicated emergency ORs, and (2) evenly reserving capacity in all elective ORs. By using a discrete event simulation model the real situation was modelled. Main outcome measures were: (1) waiting time, (2) staff overtime, and (3) OR utilisation were evaluated for the two approaches. Results indicated that the policy of reserving capacity for emergency surgery in all elective ORs led to an improvement in waiting times for emergency surgery from 74 (±4.4) minutes to 8 (±0.5) min. Working in overtime was reduced by 20%, and overall OR utilisation can increase by around 3%.

abstract = {Background Maximizing operating room utilization in orthopedic and other surgeries relies on accurate estimates of surgical control time (SCT). A variety of case and patient-specific variables can influence the duration of surgical time during revision total hip arthroplasty (THA). We hypothesized that these variables are better predictors of actual SCT (aSCT) than a surgeon's own prediction (pSCT). Methods All revision THAs from October 2008 to September 2014 from one institution were accessed. Variables for each case included aSCT, pSCT, patient age, gender, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status class, active infection, periprosthetic fracture, bone loss, heterotopic ossification, and implantation/explantation of a well-fixed acetabular/femoral component. These were incorporated in a stepwise fashion into a multivariate regression model for aSCT with a significant cutoff of 0.15. This was compared to a univariate regression model of aSCT that only used pSCT. Results In total, 516 revision THAs were analyzed. After stepwise selection, patient age and American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status were excluded from the model. The most significant increase in aSCT was seen with implantation of a new femoral component (24.0 min), followed by explantation of a well-fixed femoral component (18.7 min) and significant bone loss (15.0 min). Overall, the multivariate model had an improved r2 of 0.49, compared to 0.16 from only using pSCT. Conclusion A multivariate regression model can assist surgeons in more accurately predicting the duration of revision THAs. The strongest predictors of increased aSCT are explantation of a well-fixed femoral component, placement of an entirely new femoral component, and presence of significant bone loss.},

abstract = {Background: Accurate estimation of operating times is a prerequisite for the efficient scheduling of the operating suite. The authors, in this study, sought to compare surgeons' time estimates for elective cases with those of commercial scheduling software, and to ascertain whether improvements could be made by regression modeling. Methods: The study was conducted at the University of Washington Medical Center in three phases. Phase 1 retrospectively reviewed surgeons' time estimates and the scheduling system's estimates throughout 1 yr. In phase 2, data were collected prospectively from participating surgeons by means of a data entry form completed at the time of scheduling elective cases. Data included the procedure code, estimated operating time, estimated case difficulty, and potential factors that might affect the duration. In phase 3, identical data were collected from five selected surgeons by personal interview. Results: In Phase 1, 26 of 43 surgeons provided significantly better estimates than did the scheduling system (P < 0.01), and no surgeon was significantly worse, although the absolute errors were large (34% of 157 min average case length). In phase 2, modeling improved the accuracy of the surgeons' estimates by 11.5%, compared with the scheduling system. In phase 3, applying the model from phase 2 improved the accuracy of the surgeons' estimates by 18.2%. Conclusions: Surgeons provide more accurate time estimates than does the scheduling software as it is used in our institution. Regression modeling effects modest improvements in accuracy. Further improvements would be likely if the hospital information system could provide timely historical data and feedback to the surgeons.},

abstract = {Operating room (OR) utilization is a significant determinant of hospital profitability. One aspect of this is surgical scheduling, which depends on accurate predictions of case duration. This has been done historically by either the surgeon based on personal experience, or by an electronic health record (EHR) based on averaged historical means for case duration. Here, we compare the predicted case duration (pCD) accuracy of a novel machine-learning algorithm over a 3-month period. A proprietary machine learning algorithm was applied utilizing operating room factors such as patient demographic data, pre-surgical milestones, and hospital logistics and compared to that of a conventional EHR. Actual case duration and pCD (Leap Rail vs EHR) was obtained at one institution over the span of 3 months. Actual case duration was defined as time between patient entry into an OR and time of exit. pCD was defined as case time allotted by either Leap Rail or EHR. Cases where Leap Rail was unable to generate a pCD were excluded. A total of 1059 surgical cases were performed during the study period, with 990 cases being eligible for the study. Over all sub-specialties, Leap Rail showed a 7 min improvement in absolute difference between pCD and actual case duration when compared to conventional EHR (p < 0.0001). In aggregate, the Leap Rail method resulted in a 70% reduction in overall scheduling inaccuracy. Machine-learning algorithms are a promising method of increasing pCD accuracy and represent one means of improving OR planning and efficiency.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Case cancellations on the day of surgery reduce operating room (OR) and anesthesia group productivity. One strategy to reduce the impact of case cancellations on productivity is to assign high-risk cases to start last in the OR workday. To evaluate the utility of this intervention, we used a database of canceled cases to model the process of identifying high-risk cases and resequencing them to be the surgeons' last cases of the day. METHODS: Descriptive information was prospectively collected on 1 year of canceled cases. A comparison group of completed cases served as controls. Predictors of case cancellation were identified and used to calculate the number of cases that would require resequencing for 1 cancellation to occur at the end of the day. The proportion of total OR hours relevant to each predictor was assessed. To assess the desirability of this strategy, surgeons were surveyed regarding their scheduling preferences for patients at high risk for cancellation. RESULTS: During the study period, 946 of 12,253 cases were canceled. Strong predictors of cancellation included percentage of missed clinic appointments (number of cases requiring resequencing = 5.27) and insurance status (number of cases requiring resequencing = 8.87 for Medicaid). The predictor accounting for the most scheduled time was residence in Chicago (5.1% of total hours). No predictor both required the resequencing of 5 or fewer cases to prevent 1 cancellation in the middle of the day and accounted for >4% of scheduled time. Survey results demonstrated that in addition to cancellation probability, factors such as case complexity also influenced surgeons' sequencing preferences. CONCLUSION: Highly sensitive predictors of case cancellation are impractical for sequencing purposes because they account for too few hours of scheduled OR time. Effort invested in identifying and resequencing cases at high risk for cancellation likely has limited value. (Anesth Analg 2010;111:749-56).

abstract = {In this paper, we consider a stochastic optimization model for a surgical scheduling problem with a single operating room. The goal is to determine the optimal start times of multiple elective surgeries within a single day. The term “optimal” is defined as the largest surgically related utility value while achieving a given threshold defined by the performance variation of a reference solution. The optimization problem is analytically intractable because it involves quantities such as expectation and variance formulations. This implies that traditional mathematical programming techniques cannot be directly applied. We propose a decision support algorithm, which is a fully sequential procedure using variance screening in the first phase, and then employing multiple attribute utility theory to select the best solution in the second phase. The numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm can find a promising solution in a reasonable amount of time.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Precise estimates of final operating room demand can only be made 1 or 2 days before the day of surgery, when it is harder to adjust staffing to match demand. The authors hypothesized that the accumulating elective schedule contains useful information for predicting final case demand sufficiently in advance to readily adjust staffing. METHODS: The accumulated number of cases booked was recorded daily, from which a usable dataset comprising 146 consecutive surgical days (October 10, 2011 to May 7, 2012, after removing weekends and holidays), and each with 30 prior calendar days of booking history, was extracted. Case volume prediction was developed by extrapolation from estimates of the fraction of total cases booked each of the 30 preceding days, and averaging these with linear regression models, one for each of the 30 preceding days. Predictions were verified by comparison with actual volume. RESULTS: The elective surgery schedule accumulated approximately three cases per day, settling at a mean ± SD final daily volume of 117 ± 12 cases. The model predicted final case counts within 8.27 cases as far in advance as 14 days before the day of surgery. In the last 7 days before the day of surgery, the model predicted the case count within seven cases 80% of the time. The model was replicated at another smaller hospital, with similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The developing elective schedule predicts final case volume weeks in advance. After implementation, overly high- or low-volume days are revealed in advance, allowing nursing, ancillary service, and anesthesia managers to proactively fine-tune staffing up or down to match demand.

abstract = {Operating room management structures and interrelationships both within the operating suite and with other departments in the hospital can be very complex. Several different professional and support groups are represented that often have infrastructures of their own that may compete or conflict with the management hierarchy in the operating room. Today, there is often little actual management of the operating suite as an entity. We surveyed current operating room management in Switzerland. A questionnaire was sent to the chief anaesthesiologists of all public hospitals in Switzerland. It asked for information about the structure, organization and management of operating rooms as well as respondents' opinions and expectations about management. Derived from both the literature and the results of the survey, a 'stages of excellence' model of best practice was developed. The overall response rate was 70%. Most anaesthesiologists were unsatisfied with current management policies and structures in their operating rooms. Of the hospitals questioned, 40% did not have an information system at all for the operating rooms. The remaining 60% had an information system that allowed rough scheduling in 71%, but only a few had more sophisticated systems that enabled dynamic scheduling (19%), user-defined conflict checking (5%), administration of a subsequent patient transfer station (postanaesthesia care units, intensive medical care, intensive care units) (10%) or other more advanced uses. All hospitals questioned offered some type of ambulatory surgery in a 'hospital-integrated' manner (i.e. use of the same operating room for both in- and outpatient surgery), but none had implemented a more efficient system where outpatient surgery was performed in separate facilities. Current management of the operating room in Switzerland is far from best-practice standards.},

abstract = {In many hospitals there are patients who receive surgery later than what is medically indicated. In one of Europe's largest hospitals, the University Hospital Leuven, this is the case for approximately every third patient. Serving patients late cannot always be avoided as a highly utilized OR department will sometimes suffer capacity shortage, occasionally leading to unavoidable delays in patient care. Nevertheless, serving patients late is a problem as it exposes them to an increased health risk and hence should be avoided whenever possible. In order to improve the current situation, the delay in patient scheduling had to be quantified and the responsible mechanism, the scheduling process, had to be better understood. Drawing from this understanding, we implemented and tested realistic patient scheduling methods in a discrete event simulation model. We found that it is important to model non-elective arrivals and to include elective rescheduling decisions made on surgery day itself. Rescheduling ensures that OR related performance measures, such as overtime, will only loosely depend on the chosen patient scheduling method. We also found that capacity considerations should guide actions performed before the surgery day such as patient scheduling and patient replanning. This is the case as those scheduling strategies that ensure that OR capacity is efficiently used will also result in a high number of patients served within their medically indicated time limit. An efficient use of OR capacity can be achieved, for instance, by serving patients first come, first served. As applying first come, first served might not always be possible in a real setting, we found it is important to allow for patient replanning.},

abstract = {Background: Poor flow of patients into and out of the ICU can result in gridlock and bottlenecks that disrupt care and have a detrimental effect on patient safety and satisfaction, hospital efficiency, staff stress and morale, and revenue. Beginning in 2006, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center implemented a series of interventions to "smooth" patient flow through the system. Methods: Key activities included patient flow models based on surgical providers' predicted need for intensive care and predicted length of stay; scheduling the case and an ICU bed at the same time; capping and simulation models to identify the appropriate number of elective surgical cases to maximize occupancy without cancelling elective cases; and a morning huddle by the chief of staff, manager of patient services, and representatives from the operating room, pediatric ICUS, and anesthesia to confirm that day's plan and anticipate the next day's needs. Results: New elective surgical admissions to the pediatric ICU were restricted to a maximum of five cases per day. Diversion of patients to the cardiac ICU, keeping patients in the postanesthesia care unit longer than expected, and delaying or canceling cases are now rare events. Since implementation of the operations management interventions, there have been no cases when beds in the pediatric ICU were not available when needed for urgent medical or surgical use. Discussion: A system for smoothing flow, based on an advanced predictive model for need, occupancy, and length of stay, coupled with an active daily strategy for demand/ capacity matching of resources and needs, allowed much better early planning, predictions, and capacity management, thereby ensuring that all patients are in suitable ICU environments.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION:: We replaced a nearly fixed-salary academic physician compensation model with a mission-based productivity model with the goal of improving attending anesthesiologist productivity. METHODS:: The base salary system was stratified according to rank and clinical experience. The supplemental pay structure was linked to electronic patient records and a scheduling database to award points for clinical activity; educational, research, and administrative points systems were constructed in parallel. We analyzed monthly American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) unit data for operating room activity and physician compensation from 2000 through mid-2007, excluding the 1-yr implementation period (July 2004-June 2005) for the new model. RESULTS:: Comparing 2005-2006 with 2000-2004, quarterly ASA units increased by 14% (P = 0.0001) and quarterly ASA units per full-time equivalent increased by 31% (P < 0.0001), while quarterly ASA units per anesthetizing location decreased by 10% (P = 0.046). Compared with a baseline year (2001), Instructor and Assistant Professor faculty compensation increased more than Associate Professor and Professor faculty (P < 0.001) in both pre- and postimplementation periods. There were larger compensation increases for the postimplementation period compared with preimplementation across faculty rank groupings (P < 0.0001). Academic and educational output was stable. DISCUSSION:: Implementing a productivity-based faculty compensation model in an academic department was associated with increased mean supplemental pay with relatively fewer faculty. ASA units per month and ASA units per operating room full-time equivalent increased, and these metrics are the most likely drivers of the increased compensation. This occurred despite a slight decrease in clinical productivity as measured by ASA units per anesthetizing location. Academic and educational output was stable.

abstract = {Background: Despite benefits in quality of life, patient satisfaction, overall healthcare costs, and number of surgeries, historically fewer than 30% of patients undergo immediate breast reconstruction following mastectomy for breast cancer. A paucity of qualified oncologic and plastic surgeons coupled with inefficient use of operating room (OR) resources presents challenges in offering immediate breast reconstruction in a timely manner. To address these challenges, an immediate reconstruction swing room (IRSW) program was developed. Methods: IRSW scheduling leverages two concurrently running ORs, with the surgical oncologist and plastic surgeon moving between rooms to complete 2–4 combined mastectomy cases with immediate reconstruction, in addition to 1–2 independent cases, each operative day. The final year of traditional booking was compared with IRSW scheduling to assess wait times and reconstruction rates. Results: Comparing the 2 years, fewer surgical breast cases were performed with IRSW scheduling (1250 vs. 1178), however the overall number of oncology cases increased from 735 (59%) to 857 (73%). The number of immediate reconstructions performed increased from 75 to 139 (p < 0.0001), which reflects a mean of 1.2 IR cases versus 2.9 combined cases in IRSW. Overall, this facilitated an increase in the rate of immediate reconstruction following therapeutic mastectomy from 35 to 49% (p = 0.0004) and decreased wait times from core biopsy to surgery from 70 to 52 days (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: A multidisciplinary model with optimized scheduling has the potential to improve resource utilization and access to breast cancer care.},

For each scenario, average number of procedures performed, surgery time, daily over- and under-utilized time, and staffing costs per operation were assessed. We also studied whether scheduling short and long procedures in separate rooms would amplify the effects of the parallel processing. All parallel work-flow models demonstrated better cost-efficiency than the traditionally sequenced working pattern. Staffing costs per procedure were 7% lower in the best induction model than in the traditional model.

The simulations performed examined the number of beds in the PACU in an ideal situation or in the case of reduction in the number of porters. We then analyzed the variation of number of beds occupied per hour in the PACU when the time spent by patients in the PACU or the number of porters varied.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In elderly, high-risk patients, operating room (OR) turnaround times are especially difficult to estimate, and the managerial implications of patient age and ASA physical status for OR management decisions remain unclear. We hypothesized that evaluating patient age and ASA physical status in the right model would improve accuracy of turnaround time estimates and, thus, would have decisive implications for OR management. METHODS: By using various multivariate techniques, we modeled turnaround times of 13,632 OR procedures with respect to multiple variables including surgical list, age, ASA physical status, duration of the procedure, and duration of the preceding procedure. We first assessed correlations and general descriptive features of the data. Then, we constructed decision tables for OR management consisting of 50th and 95th percentiles of age/ASA-dependent estimates of turnaround times. In addition, we applied linear and generalized linear multivariate models to predict turnaround times. The forecasting power of the models was assessed in view of single cases but also in view of critical managerial key figures (50th and 95th percentile turnaround times). The models were calibrated on 80% of the data, and their predictive value was tested on the remaining 20%. We considered our data in a Monte Carlo simulation to deduce actual reductions of overutilized OR time when applying the results as presented in this work. RESULTS: Using the best models, we achieved an increase in predictive accuracy of 7.7% (all lists), ranging from 2.5% (general surgery) to 21.0% (trauma surgery) relative to age/ASA-independent medians of turnaround times. All models decreased the forecasting error, signifying a relevant increase in planning accuracy. We constructed a management decision table to estimate age/ASA-dependent turnaround time for OR scheduling at our hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The decision tables allow OR managers at our hospital to schedule procedures more accurately. Evaluation of patient age and ASA physical status as variables can help to better predict turnaround times, which can facilitate scheduling, for example, to schedule overlapping induction rooms, to reduce overutilized OR time by optimizing allocation of patients to several ORs, and to improve logistics of prioritizing transportation of advanced age/high ASA physical status patients to the OR.},

Smoking, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and abnormal white blood cell count were not significant predictors. Conclusions Higher BMI, younger age, male gender, higher ASA, and abnormal LFTs are possible predictors of prolonged LC duration and can aid in operating room scheduling and utilization.},

abstract = {Objectives: To design a methodology to predict operative times for robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) based on variation in institutional, patient, and disease characteristics to help in operating room scheduling and quality control. Patients and Methods: The model included preoperative variables and therefore can be used for prediction of surgical times: institutional volume, age, gender, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, history of prior surgery and radiation, clinical stage, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, type, technique of diversion, and the extent of lymph node dissection. A conditional inference tree method was used to fit a binary decision tree predicting operative time. Permutation tests were performed to determine the variables having the strongest association with surgical time. The data were split at the value of this variable resulting in the largest difference in means for the surgical time across the split. This process was repeated recursively on the resultant data sets until the permutation tests showed no significant association with operative time. Results: In all, 2 134 procedures were included. The variable most strongly associated with surgical time was type of diversion, with ileal conduits being 70 min shorter (P < 0.001). Amongst patients who received neobladders, the type of lymph node dissection was also strongly associated with surgical time. Amongst ileal conduit patients, institutional surgeon volume (>66 RARCs) was important, with those with a higher volume being 55 min shorter (P < 0.001). The regression tree output was in the form of box plots that show the median and ranges of surgical times according to the patient, disease, and institutional characteristics. Conclusion: We developed a method to estimate operative times for RARC based on patient, disease, and institutional metrics that can help operating room scheduling for RARC.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: An operating room (OR) department has adopted an efficient business model and subsequently investigated how efficiency could be further improved. The aim of this study is to show the efficiency improvement of lowering organizational barriers and applying advanced mathematical techniques. METHODS: We applied advanced mathematical algorithms in combination with scenarios that model relaxation of various organizational barriers using prospectively collected data. The setting is the main inpatient OR department of a university hospital, which sets its surgical case schedules 2 wk in advance using a block planning method. The main outcome measures are the number of freed OR blocks and OR utilization. RESULTS: Lowering organizational barriers and applying mathematical algorithms can yield a 4.5% point increase in OR utilization (95% confidence interval 4.0%-5.0%). This is obtained by reducing the total required OR time. CONCLUSIONS: Efficient OR departments can further improve their efficiency. The paper shows that a radical cultural change that comprises the use of mathematical algorithms and lowering organizational barriers improves OR utilization. {\textcopyright} 2007 by International Anesthesia Research Society.},

abstract = {Objective To investigate sedation and anesthesia trends and practice patterns for procedures in the cardiac electrophysiology laboratory (EPL). Design A survey distributed by e-mail. Setting US teaching hospitals with a training program in cardiac electrophysiology. Participants Cardiologists involved in procedures in the electrophysiology laboratory of academic electrophysiology programs. Interventions A survey was e-mailed to the selected programs. The survey questions included the use of anesthesia professional (MD/CRNA) and nonanesthesia professional (RN) services, medications administered, commonly performed airway interventions, satisfaction with anesthesia services, and reasons that anesthesia professionals are not used when RNs administer sedation. Measurements and Main Results Of the 95 academic electrophysiology programs surveyed, there were 38 responses (40%). The majority (71%) of respondents used a combined model of care with both anesthesia professional care and nonanesthesia professional (RN) sedation, although there were EPLs that had exclusively anesthesia professional (n = 6) and exclusively nonanesthesia professional coverage (n = 5); 26.3% of respondents answered that care by an anesthesia professional was warranted most (>50%) of the time regardless of their current care model. The main reasons cited for having RN-administered sedation were the lack of availability of anesthesia professionals, difficulty with scheduling, and increased operating room suite turnover times. Programs using exclusively RN sedation (13%) reported all levels of anesthesia including general anesthesia (patient unarousable to repeated deep stimulation). Conclusions This survey suggested that sedation for EPL procedures was sometimes allowed to progress to deep sedation and general anesthesia and that selection of anesthesia provider frequently was made based on availability, operating room efficiency, and economic reasons before patient safety issues. The implications of the survey must be explored further in a larger-scale sample population before more definitive statements can be made, but results suggested that sedation in the EPL is an area that would benefit from updated guidelines specific to the current practice as well as attention from the anesthesia community to address the deficiency in provision of anesthesia care. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The Acute Care Surgery model has been widely adopted by hospitals across the United States, with Acute Care Surgery services managing Emergency General Surgery patients that were previously being treated by General Surgery. In this analysis, we evaluate the impact of an Acute Care Surgery service model on General Surgery at the University of Vermont Medical Center using three metrics: under-utilized time, spillover time, and a financial ratio of work Relative Value Units over clinical Full Time Equivalents. These metrics are evaluated and used to identify three-dimensional Pareto optimality of General Surgery prior to and after the October 2015 tactical allocation to the Acute Care Surgery model. Our analysis was further substantiated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo model for Bayesian Inference. We applied multi-objective Pareto and Bayesian breakpoint analysis to three operating room metrics to assess the impact of new operating room management decisions. In the two-dimensional space of Fig. 2, panel a), the post-tactical allocation front lies closer to the origin representing more optimal solutions for productivity and under-utilized time. The post-tactical allocation front is also closer to the origin for productivity and spillover time as shown in the two-dimensional space of Fig. 2, panel b). The results of the three-dimensional multi-objective analysis of Fig. 3 illustrate that the GS post-tactical allocation Pareto-surface is contained within a much smaller volume of space than the GS pre-tactical allocation Pareto-surface. The post-tactical allocation Pareto-surface is slightly lower along the z-axis, representing lower productivity than the pre-tactical allocation surface. This methodology might contribute to the external benchmarking and monitoring of perioperative services by visualizing the operational implications following tactical decisions in operating room management.},

abstract = {Background: Variability in operating room (OR) time causes overutilization and underutilization of the available ORs. There is evidence that for a given type of procedure, the surgeon is the major source of variability in OR time. The primary aim was to quantify the variability between surgeons and anesthesiologists. As illustration, the value of modeling the individual surgeons and anesthesiologist for OR time prediction was estimated. Methods: OR data containing 16,480 cases were obtained from a general surgery department. The total amount of variability in OR time accounted for by the type of procedure, first and second surgeon, and the anesthesiologist was determined with the use of linear mixed models. The effect on OR time prediction was evaluated as reduction in overtime and idle time per case. RESULTS: Differences between first surgeons can account for only 2.9% (2.0%-4.2%) of the variability in OR time. Differences between anesthesiologists can account for 0.1% (0.0%-0.3%) of the variability in OR time. Incorporating the individual surgeons and anesthesiologists led to an average reduction of overtime and idle time of 1.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.7-2.0, 10.5% reduction) minutes and 3.0 (95% confidence interval, 2.8%-3.2, 17.0% reduction) minutes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with the type of procedure, differences between surgeons account for a small part of OR time variability. The impact of differences between anesthesiologists on OR time is negligible. A prediction model incorporating the individual surgeons and anesthesiologists has an increased precision, but improvements are likely too marginal to have practical consequences for OR scheduling.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:: When the phase I postanesthesia care unit (PACU) is at capacity, completed cases need to be held in the operating room (OR), causing a "PACU delay." Statistical methods based on historical data can optimize PACU staffing to achieve the least possible labor cost at a given service level. A decision support process to alert PACU charge nurses that the PACU is at or near maximum census might be effective in lessening the incidence of delays and reducing over-utilized OR time, but only if alerts are timely (i.e., neither too late nor too early to act upon) and the PACU slot can be cleared quickly. We evaluated the maximum potential benefit of such a system, using assumptions deliberately biased toward showing utility. METHODS:: We extracted 3 years of electronic PACU data from a tertiary care medical center. At this hospital, PACU admissions were limited by neither inadequate PACU staffing nor insufficient PACU beds. We developed a model decision support system that simulated alerts to the PACU charge nurse. PACU census levels were reconstructed from the data at a 1-minute level of resolution and used to evaluate if subsequent delays would have been prevented by such alerts. The model assumed there was always a patient ready for discharge and an available hospital bed. The time from each alert until the maximum census was exceeded ("alert lead time") was determined. Alerts were judged to have utility if the alert lead time fell between various intervals from 15 or 30 minutes to 60, 75, or 90 minutes after triggering. In addition, utility for reducing over-utilized OR time was assessed using the model by determining if 2 patients arrived from 5 to 15 minutes of each other when the PACU census was at 1 patient less than the maximum census. RESULTS:: At most, 23% of alerts arrived 30 to 60 minutes prior to the admission that resulted in the PACU exceeding the specified maximum capacity. When the notification window was extended to 15 to 90 minutes, the maximum utility was <50%. At most, 45% of alerts potentially would have resulted in reassigning the last available PACU slot to 1 OR versus another within 15 minutes of the original assignment. CONCLUSIONS:: Despite multiple biases that favored effectiveness, the maximum potential benefit of a decision support system to mitigate PACU delays on the day on the surgery was below the 70% minimum threshold for utility of automated decision support messages, previously established via meta-analysis. Neither reduction in PACU delays nor reassigning promised PACU slots based on reducing over-utilized OR time were realized sufficiently to warrant further development of the system. Based on these results, the only evidence-based method of reducing PACU delays is to adjust PACU staffing and staff scheduling using computational algorithms to match the historical workload (e.g., as developed in 2001).

This Special Article is about the latter topic. Using narrative review, we show that there are two principal opportunities for net cost reduction. One opportunity is to reduce unnecessary interventions that do not have potential to benefit patients (e.g., preoperative laboratory studies in healthy patients undergoing low-risk surgery and use of substantial fresh gas flows with volatile anesthetics). The other opportunity is to optimize staff scheduling, case scheduling, and staff assignment. These two are the same as the principal ways that a positive return on investment can be achieved from use of an anesthesia information management system. Three other opportunities are much less likely to achieve as large (if any) net cost reduction among all patients but may at some hospitals. These are to reduce cancellations, operating room times, and/or hospital postoperative lengths of stay.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To model the financial impact of policies governing the scheduling of overlapping surgeries, and to identify optimal solutions that maximize operating efficiency that satisfy the fiduciary duty to patients. BACKGROUND Hospitals depend on procedural revenue to maintain financial health as the recent pandemic has revealed. Proposed policies governing the scheduling of overlapping surgeries may dramatically impact hospital revenue. To date, the potential financial impact has not been modeled. METHODS A linear forecasting model based on a logic matrix decision tree enabled an analysis of surgeon productivity annualized over a fiscal year. The model applies procedural and operational variables to policy constraints limiting surgical scheduling. Model outputs included case and financial metrics modeled over 1000-surgeon-year simulations. Case metrics included annual case volume, case mix, operating room (OR) utilization, surgeon utilization, idle time and staff overtime hours. Financial outputs included annual revenue, expenses and contribution margin. RESULTS The model was validated against surgical data. Case and financial metrics decreased as a function of increasingly restrictive scheduling scenarios, with the greatest contribution margin loses ($1,650,000 per surgeon-year) realized with the introduction of policies mandating that a second patient could not enter the OR until the critical portion of the first surgery was completed. We identify an optimal scheduling scenario that maximizes surgeon efficiency, minimizes OR idle time and revenue loses, and satisfies ethical obligations to patients. CONCLUSIONS Hospitals may expect significant financial loses with the introduction of policies restricting OR scheduling. We identify an optimal solution that maximizes efficiency while satisfying ethical duty to patients. This forecast is immediately relevant to any hospital system that depends upon procedural revenue.},

abstract = {Hospital scheduling presents huge challenges for the healthcare industry. Various studies have been conducted in many different countries with focus on both elective and non-elective surgeries. There are important variables and factors that need to be taken into considerations. Different methods and approaches have also been used to examine hospital scheduling. Notwithstanding the continuous changes in modern healthcare services and, in particular, hospital operations, consistent reviews and further studies are still required. The importance of hospital scheduling, particularly, has become more critical as the trade-off between limited resources and overwhelming demand is becoming more evident. This situation is even more pressing in a volatile country where shootings and bombings in public areas happened. Hospital scheduling for elective surgeries in volatile country such as Iraq is therefore often interrupted by non-elective surgeries due to war-related incidents. Hence, this paper intends to address this issue by proposing a hospital scheduling model with focus on neuro-surgery department. The aim of the model is to maximize utilization of operating room while concurrently minimizing idle time of surgery. The study focused on neurosurgery department in Al-Shahid Ghazi Al-Hariri hospital in Baghdad, Iraq. In doing so, a Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated where interruptions of non-elective surgery are incorporated into the main elective surgery based model. Computational experiment is then carried out to test the model. The result indicates that the model is feasible and can be solved in reasonable times. Nonetheless, its feasibility is further tested as the problems size and the computation times is getting bigger and longer. Application of heuristic methods is the way forward to ensure better practicality of the proposed model. In the end, the potential benefit of this study and the proposed model is discussed.},

abstract = {Background: Adult trauma centers (TCs) in the United States may be verified with an on-call operating room team if the performance improvement program shows no adverse outcome. Using queuing and simulation methodology, this study attempts to add a volume guideline for injured children. Methods: Data from 63 verified TCs identified demographic factors including specific information regarding the first pediatric trauma-related operation done between 11 pm and 7 am each month for 1 year. Results: The annual pediatric admits correlated with the number of operations (383) done from 11 pm to 7 am (P < .001). The probability of operation within 30 minutes of arrival varies with the number of admits and the percent of penetrating vs blunt injuries. This likely number of operations from 11 pm to 7 am beginning within 30 minutes of patient arrival would be 3.45, 4.21, and 4.95 for TCs admitting 150, 250, and 350 injured children per year, respectively. The probability that 2 rooms would be occupied simultaneously is 0.074 and 0.109 for centers with 160 and 260 pediatric trauma admissions, respectively.

abstract = {This paper deals with an Integrated Elective Surgery-Scheduling Problem (IESSP) that arises in a privately operated healthcare facility. It aims to optimize the resource utilization of the entire surgery process including pre-operative, per-operative and post-operative activities. Moreover, it addresses a specific feature of private facilities where surgeons are independent service providers and may conduct their surgeries in different private healthcare facilities. Thus, the problem requires the assignment of surgery patients to hospital beds, operating rooms and recovery beds as well as their sequencing over a 1-day period while taking into account surgeons' availability constraints. We present two Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILP) that model the IESSP as a three-stage hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem with recirculation, resource synchronization, dedicated machines, and blocking constraints. To assess the empirical performance of the proposed models, we conducted experiments on real-world data of a Tunisian private clinic: Clinique Ennasr and on randomly generated instances. Two criteria were minimised: the patients' average length of stay and the number of patients' overnight stays. The computational results show that the proposed models can solve instances with up to 44 surgical cases in a reasonable CPU time using a general-purpose MILP solver.},

abstract = {Operating rooms (ORs) play a substantial role in hospital profitability, and their optimal utilization is conducive to containing the cost of surgical service delivery, shortening surgical patient wait times, and increasing patient admissions. We extend the OR planning and scheduling problem from a single independent hospital to a coalition of multiple hospitals in a strategic network, where a pool of patients, surgeons, and ORs are collaboratively planned. To solve the resulting mixed-integer dual resource constrained model, we develop a novel logic-based Benders' decomposition approach that employs an allocation master problem, sequencing sub-problems for each hospital-day, and novel multistrategy Benders' feasibility and optimality cuts. We investigate various patient-tosurgeon allocation flexibilities, as well as the impact of surgeon schedule tightness. Using real data obtained from the General Surgery Departments of the University Health Network (UHN) hospitals, consisting of Toronto General Hospital, Toronto Western Hospital, and Princess Margret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (who already engage in some collaborative resource sharing),we find that on average, collaborative OR scheduling with traditional patient-to-surgeon allocation flexibility results in 6% cost-savings, while flexible patient-to-surgeon allocation flexibility increases cost-savings to 40%, and surgeon schedule tightness can impact costs by 15%. The collective impact of our collaboration and patient flexibility results in between 45% and 63% savings per surgery. We also use a game theoretic approach to fairly redistribute the payoff acquired from a coalition of hospitals and to empirically show coalitional stability among hospitals.},
